Information needed?: Information needed

**Context:**

Sometimes you only get one slide, one email, or one meeting to show why research matters. This prompt helps you distill your work into a clear, compelling one-pager that communicates outcomes, connects to business priorities, and makes your impact impossible to ignore.

**Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help creating a one-pager that shows the business value of research.

I need help creating a one-pager that communicates the value of user research to stakeholders or leadership. Act as a thought partner to guide me step-by-step in deciding what to include, how to structure it, and how to frame the outcomes in a way that shows strategic and business impact. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**1. Project context:**

- What research project or set of insights is this based on?

[Insert, e.g., “A multi-phase study on improving trial-to-subscription conversion.”]

- Who is the audience for the one-pager?

[Insert, e.g., “VPs of Product and Marketing.”]

- What outcomes or actions are you hoping this one-pager supports?

[Insert, e.g., “Buy-in for implementation and investment in more research at this stage.”]

**Guide me through building the one-pager:**

**2. Define the goal of the one-pager**

Help me clarify what this should achieve.

- Is this to show outcomes, secure funding, support a decision, or something else?
- What do I want someone to know, feel, and do after reading it?

**3. Select the key messages**

Guide me in choosing the most important takeaways.

- What 2–3 insights or themes are most relevant to this audience?
- How can I tie each insight to a business impact, opportunity, or risk?

**4. Highlight outcomes and next steps**

Help me clearly show the value.

- What decisions, changes, or actions came (or should come) from this research?
- What’s the ROI—time saved, risk avoided, opportunity uncovered?

**5. Make it visual and scannable**

Guide me in formatting and layout.

- What sections or structure will make this easy to skim?
- Should I use visuals like user quotes, stats, diagrams, or flows?

**6. Tailor the tone and framing for leadership**

Help me speak their language.

- What kinds of words and framing connect with execs?
- How can I balance being concise, strategic, and persuasive?

**7. Reflection and refinement**

Help me check whether the one-pager delivers.

- Is it focused and not overloaded with detail?
- Does it clearly communicate business relevance, not just research activity?
- Will it be remembered and shared—or forgotten?

Please guide me step-by-step to create a powerful one-pager that highlights the business value of user research and helps secure alignment, momentum, or buy-in.

**Follow-up prompts:**

- Help me write a short, punchy executive summary
- Suggest section headers and layout for the one-pager
- Draft two versions: one for product, one for execs
- Review a rough draft and suggest edits for clarity and tone
- Help me build a one-pager template I can reuse for future projects
