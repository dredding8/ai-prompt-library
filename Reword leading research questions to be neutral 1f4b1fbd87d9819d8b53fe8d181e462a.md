# Reword leading research questions to be neutral

Category: Methods, Planning
Information needed?: Information needed

## **Context:**

Leading questions can bias participant responses and compromise your research’s validity. This prompt helps you assess an interview script for leading questions, identify biases, and rephrase them into neutral, open-ended questions using the TEDW framework: **Tell me about… Explain… Describe… Walk me through…**

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM. Upload your interview script to identify and refine leading questions into neutral ones.

“I need help reviewing an interview script for leading or biased questions and rewording them into neutral, open-ended queries using the TEDW framework (Tell, Explain, Describe, Walk). Guide me through identifying problematic questions and refining them for qualitative research.

**Analyze the uploaded script:**

1. Highlight all leading or biased questions.
    1. Example: “Don’t you find this feature useful?”
2. Explain why each question is leading.
    1. Example: “This question suggests the participant should find the feature useful.”

**Reword using the TEDW framework:**

For each leading question, provide a neutral, open-ended alternative:

1. **Tell me about** your experience using [feature/topic].
    1. Example rewording: “Don’t you think the new layout makes it easier to find what you’re looking for?” → “Tell me about your experience navigating the new layout.”
2. **Explain** what worked well or didn’t work well for you.
    1. Example rewording: “Was this process frustrating for you?” → “Explain what stood out to you as helpful or challenging during the process.”
3. **Describe** a recent time when you [action/topic].
    1. Example rewording: “How easy was it for you to find what you needed?” → “Describe a recent time when you tried to find something in the app.”
4. **Walk me through** how you approached [specific task/topic].
    1. Example rewording: “Did you follow the steps as outlined?” → “Walk me through how you completed the steps.”

**Create a checklist for refining interview questions:**

- Does the question suggest or imply a specific answer?
- Does it include emotionally charged words or strong adjectives (e.g., “great,” “bad”)?
- Does it assume participant behavior or experiences (e.g., “When you found it useful…”)?

If yes, rephrase using the TEDW framework:

- Make the question open-ended and exploratory.
- Focus on participant-driven responses and experiences.
- Allow for a broad range of possible answers.

## Reflection questions:

- Do the reworded questions encourage participants to share detailed, unbiased insights?
- Have I avoided assumptions about participant experiences or preferences?
- Are the questions simple and clear, avoiding jargon or overly complex phrasing?
- Am I leaving space for participants to provide unexpected or nuanced answers?
- Could I refine the phrasing further to better match the research goals?

Please analyze the uploaded interview script and rephrase any leading questions into TEDW-aligned alternatives.”

## **Follow-Up Prompts:**

- “Summarize the flagged leading questions and their reworded versions into a table for review.”
- “Suggest additional open-ended prompts I could add to make the script more exploratory.”
- “Provide guidance on how to test the revised questions with team members before live interviews.”
- “Draft a quick explanation to stakeholders on why neutral, open-ended questions are essential for high-quality insights.”
- “Identify any patterns or common issues in the original script that I should address in future interview guides.”
