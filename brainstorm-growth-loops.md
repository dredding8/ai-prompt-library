# Brainstorm Growth Loops

Prompt: Act as a go-to-market strategist for a <product>.

Based on the attached information about my product, help us identify at least one flywheel that will speed up our  traction so we will not have to account only for “random referrals.”

Consider 5 types of Growth Loops we defined with Ognjen Bošković, CEO Raven:

1. Viral Loop: Product-related content shared on other platforms brings new users into the ecosystem.
2. Usage Loop: Users create something (video, prototype, email, stats) and share it, driving more engagement.
3. Collaboration Loop: Users start creating an asset (website, code, design, email, etc.) and invite colleagues to co-create and collaborate.
4. User-Generated Loop: Users discover the platform through content and start creating more, attracting even more users.
5. Referral Loop: After experiencing the product's value, users invite others in exchange for incentives (credits, premium features, compensation).
