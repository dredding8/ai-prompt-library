Information needed?: Information needed

## **Context:**

A well-structured workshop can align teams, define goals, and set the tone for a successful discovery project. This prompt helps you design a workshop agenda that encourages collaboration, clarifies objectives, and identifies key questions and priorities.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to create a tailored workshop agenda for kicking off discovery projects.

“I need help designing a workshop to kick off a discovery project. The goal of the workshop is to align the team on objectives, identify research questions, and set priorities for the discovery phase. Guide me step-by-step to create an actionable agenda.

**Define the purpose of the workshop:**

- What is the goal of this discovery project?
    - Example: “To understand user pain points in the onboarding process and explore opportunities for improvement.”
- Who will attend the workshop?
    - Example: “Cross-functional team including product managers, designers, and researchers.”

**Outline the workshop structure:**

What key activities will drive alignment and clarity?

1. **Icebreaker and Goal Setting (10-15 minutes).** Purpose: Build rapport and clarify the workshop’s purpose.
- Icebreaker activity: “If you could instantly solve one problem for our users, what would it be?”
- Goal-setting discussion: “What does success look like for this discovery project?”
- Record answers on a shared whiteboard or tool like Miro.
1. **Align on Objectives (15-20 minutes):** Define the problem space and scope of the project.
- Activity: Problem Framing “What problem are we trying to solve for our users?”
- Group similar responses into themes.
- Output: A clear, concise problem statement.
1. **Brainstorm Research Questions (30 minutes):** Identify the key questions to guide discovery efforts.
- Activity: Research Question Brainstorm: “What do we need to learn to solve this problem?”
- Group and prioritize questions using categories like “must-know,” “nice-to-know,” and “out-of-scope.”
- Output: A prioritized list of research questions.
1. **Stakeholder Priorities and Assumptions (20-30 minutes):** Align on priorities and uncover assumptions.
- Activity: Assumption Mapping: “What assumptions are we making about the problem or users?”
- Group assumptions into categories like “validated,” “needs validation,” and “uncertain.”
- Output: A clear map of assumptions to address in discovery.
1. **Next Steps and Action Plan (15 minutes):** Create a plan for the discovery phase.
- Activity: Roadmap Brainstorm: What are the immediate next steps to begin this discovery?”
- Assign owners to key tasks and set a timeline.
- Output: A discovery roadmap with assigned responsibilities.

## Reflection questions:

- Does the workshop structure ensure alignment and clarity for all participants?
- Are the activities engaging and productive for a cross-functional team?
- Have I left enough time for discussion while keeping the agenda focused?
- Are the outputs actionable and aligned with the discovery project’s goals?

Please expand this into a complete workshop agenda, including specific activities, questions, and desired outputs for each phase.”

## **Follow-Up Prompts:**

- “Create a slide deck to guide participants through the workshop activities.”
- “Draft a summary email to share the workshop outputs and next steps with the team.”
- “Suggest alternative brainstorming methods for research questions to fit different team dynamics.”
- “Propose strategies to manage difficult discussions or conflicting priorities during the workshop.”
- “Write a checklist of materials and tools needed to run the workshop effectively.”
