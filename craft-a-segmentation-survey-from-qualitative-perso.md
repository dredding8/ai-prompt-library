# Craft a segmentation survey from qualitative personas

Category: Deliverables, Methods
Information needed?: Information needed

**Context:**

You’ve created thoughtful, grounded personas from qualitative research—but now you need to test whether those personas exist in your broader audience. This prompt helps you design a segmentation survey that captures key traits, behaviors, and mindsets—so you can identify patterns at scale.

**Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help turning qualitative personas into a segmentation survey.

I need help turning a set of qualitative personas into a segmentation survey that I can send to a broader audience. Act as a thought partner to guide me step-by-step through identifying distinguishing traits, writing survey questions, and structuring the survey to reveal meaningful segments. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**1. Project context:**

- **What are the personas based on?**

[Insert, e.g., “Diary studies and in-depth interviews with 20 users.”]

- **Roughly how many personas are there, and what distinguishes them?**

[Insert, e.g., “Three personas that differ in goals, digital fluency, and workflows.”]

- **What is the goal of this segmentation survey?**

[Insert, e.g., “To understand how common these personas are among our total user base and guide product prioritization.”]

**Guide me through building the segmentation survey:**

**2. Identify key differentiators between personas:**

Help me figure out what behaviors, attitudes, or needs distinguish each group.

- What patterns in the qualitative data really set these personas apart?
- Which traits are observable and surveyable—not just deep motivations?

**3. Translate traits into survey items:**

Guide me in writing effective survey questions.

- How can I frame questions to measure things like goals, mindsets, or habits without leading the participant?
- What’s the best way to ask about behaviors vs. attitudes?

**4. Choose the right question formats:**

Help me pick question types that match my goals.

- When should I use Likert scales, multiple choice, check-all-that-apply, or ranking?
- How do I avoid overwhelming respondents while still gathering depth?

**5. Structure the survey logically:**

Guide me in organizing the flow of the survey.

- How should I group questions to avoid bias or priming?
- What intro or transition language will help set the right context?

**6. Plan for segmentation analysis:**

Help me design the survey with analysis in mind.

- How can I tag responses to later group participants into segments?
- What criteria or clustering methods should I consider post-survey?

**7. Reflection and refinement:**

Help me assess whether the survey is strong and scalable:

- Are the questions clear, neutral, and easy to answer?
- Do they truly reflect what distinguishes the personas?
- Will the results give me what I need to segment the broader audience?

Please guide me step-by-step to create a segmentation survey that scales my personas and helps me understand which types of users exist across our broader population.

**Follow-up prompts:**

- Help me draft a short intro for the survey to explain its purpose to participants
- Suggest validation questions to include for data quality
- Recommend tools or formats for analyzing the segmentation data
- Draft sample survey questions based on traits like decision-making style, needs, or confidence
- Propose ways to map survey results back to the original personas
