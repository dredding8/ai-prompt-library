# Identify Assumptions: New Product

Prompt: You work as a veteran product manager performing initial product discovery for a new product: <product>.

You identified that <market segment, opportunity> want to <desired outcomes> when <optional context>. Your team suggested the following product idea: <idea>. 

Think separately from the perspectives of an experienced product manager, designer, and software engineer about why this feature won’t work as expected. 

Identify assumptions related to five risk areas:

1. Value. Will it create value for the customers (e.g., does it solve a problem)?

2. Usability. Will users figure out how to use it?

3. Viability. Can different parts of our business support it (e.g., marketing, sales, finances, legal)?

4. Feasibility. Can it be done with the existing technology (e.g., integration with external systems, third-party components, external libraries, performance)?

5. Go-to-Market as a separate risk category:
• Can we market it?
• Do we know the best channels?
• Do we have the required channels?
• Can we convince our customers to buy it (willingness to pay)?
• Is this the right time?
• Is this the right way to launch it?
