Product Strategy Canvas

1. Vision

How can I inspire people to get up every day and come to work? What are we aspiring to achieve? What values do we uphold?

Start with something simple. Your vision will evolve along with other elements of the strategy.

2. Market Segments

The market is defined by people's problems. For example, IKEA’s market is people who want to get high-quality home furnishings at low prices.

What are the customers’ jobs to be done? Within the market, there are groups of people with similar jobs, desired outcomes, and success metrics.

Are there any constraints, e.g., geography, language?
What will be your first customer segment?

3. Relative Costs

What do we optimize for? Do we optimize for low cost, like Southwest Airlines, or for unique value, like Starbucks?

Low costs might be a priority, but they do not necessarily mean having low prices.

4. Value Proposition

For each Market Segment (persona and jobs to be done), define:
1. What before: Existing, problematic state (e.g., maintaining tasks in Excel)
2. How: Features and capabilities that change the situation (e.g., Kanban board)
3. What after: The benefits and outcomes (e.g., organized tasks with clear deadlines, increased productivity)
4. Alternatives: your unique value, unique attributes, and optionally relative pricing vs. competitors and substitutes (often represented as a Value Curve).

5. Trade-offs
Trade-offs define what NOT to do. For example, IKEA doesn't sell assembled furniture and limits available choices (e.g., materials).

Trade-offs create focus and amplify the value.

6. Key Metrics

Define a few key metrics to measure how your product is doing and whether the strategy is working.

7. Growth

How do we envision growth? Is it PLG or Sales-Led Growth? What are our preferred Sales and Marketing channels? Will we rely on Social Media, SEO, Influencers, or Resellers?

8. Capabilities

What competencies and resources do we need to acquire?
Do we need suppliers or partners?

9. Can’t / Won’t

What makes us think our competitors can’t or won’t copy our strategy? Is this unique value proposition, activities, knowledge, culture, partners, IP?

It’s essential. The moment you succeed, someone will try to do the same.
