Category: Analysis
Information needed?: Some information needed

## **Context:**

Analyzing qualitative data can feel overwhelming when faced with a large volume of open-ended responses, transcripts, or notes. This prompt provides step-by-step guidance to help you organize, explore, and synthesize your data into meaningful themes and insights.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help starting qualitative data analysis.

“I’m feeling stuck on where to start with analyzing qualitative data. Guide me step-by-step to make sense of my data and generate meaningful insights. Assume I have raw, open-ended responses or interview transcripts, and I’m not sure how to begin. Please provide suggestions for each step based on my needs.

**Context of project:**

[Insert the project’s goals, insights, and key outcomes]

**Organize the data:**

I’m unsure how to structure my data for analysis. Suggest ways to clean, organize, and prepare it for review.

**Explore the data:**

What are effective ways to familiarize myself with the content? Guide me to identify patterns or recurring themes without making assumptions.

**Identify themes:**

How do I group related responses into themes? Suggest methods for clustering the data, such as affinity mapping or tagging, and explain how to label themes.

 **Refine and synthesize themes:**

What steps can I take to refine initial themes and ensure they are distinct and meaningful? Suggest ways to review grouped data, split broad categories into sub-themes, or connect related insights.

**Summarize the findings:**

Guide me in turning themes into actionable insights. Suggest how to write clear, concise statements for each theme and provide examples of supporting evidence I could include, such as quotes or examples.

## **Reflection questions:**

Help me reflect on the process to ensure I’ve captured meaningful insights:

- Have I covered all major patterns in the data?
- Are there any gaps or unaddressed areas?
- How can I ensure these insights align with my research goals?

Please guide me step-by-step and offer suggestions or ideas for each stage, especially if I’m unsure how to answer some of these questions or don’t know where to begin. Tailor your advice to help me feel confident and organized throughout the analysis process.”
