Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**Project context:**

- What is the focus of the research?

[Insert details, e.g., “Understanding pain points in the onboarding process.”]

- Who is the primary audience for the deliverable?

[Insert details, e.g., “Product managers and designers.”]

- What decisions or actions should the deliverable support?

[Insert goals, e.g., “Prioritizing design improvements to streamline onboarding.”]

**Clarify the purpose of the deliverable:**

Help me define what the deliverable needs to achieve.

- How can the deliverable help my audience understand the research findings?
- What role does it play in driving decisions or actions?

**Brainstorm potential deliverables:**

Guide me in brainstorming different deliverable options that could suit the project.

- What are possible formats (e.g., reports, presentations, dashboards, personas, journey maps)?
- How can I decide whether the deliverable should be detailed or high-level?

**Evaluate deliverable options:**

Help me weigh the pros and cons of each potential deliverable.

- Which options best align with the audience’s needs and preferences?

- What key sections or components should it include?
- How can I ensure the deliverable communicates the most important findings clearly?

## **Reflection questions:**

Help me reflect on whether the chosen deliverable aligns with the project’s needs:

- Will it effectively communicate the research findings to the intended audience?
- Does it support the decisions or actions the stakeholders need to make?
- Are there any gaps or opportunities to refine the deliverable further?

Please guide me step-by-step to brainstorm and select the best deliverable for my research project, ensuring it aligns with the context I’ve provided and achieves the intended impact.”
