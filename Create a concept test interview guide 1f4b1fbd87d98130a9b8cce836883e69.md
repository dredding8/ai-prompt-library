Information needed?: Some information needed

## **Context:**

Running a concept test requires asking the right questions to uncover whether a concept resonates with users, how it fits their needs, and what improvements are necessary. This prompt guides you step-by-step to brainstorm questions and create an effective concept test interview guide, acting as a thought partner throughout the process.

“I need help creating an interview guide for a concept test. I’m unsure about the types of questions to ask and how to structure the session. Act as a thought partner to guide me step-by-step in brainstorming meaningful questions, framing them effectively, and designing a clear and engaging guide. Assume I’m starting from scratch. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**Concept test context:**

- What concept is being tested?

[Insert details, e.g., “A new feature for simplifying task management in our app.”]

- Who are the target participants?

[Insert details, e.g., “Current users of the app who manage team projects.”]

- What is the primary goal of the concept test?

[Insert goals, e.g., “To understand whether the concept addresses user pain points and fits into their workflow.”]

**Define the objectives of the concept test:**

Help me clarify what I want to learn from this test.

- What decisions or actions will the insights inform?
- How can I ensure the objectives are specific and actionable?

**Brainstorm key areas to explore:**

Guide me in identifying the themes or topics the questions should cover.

- How can I explore users’ initial reactions to the concept?
- What questions will help me understand whether the concept addresses user needs?
- How can I identify potential pain points or areas for improvement?

**Craft meaningful questions:**

Help me brainstorm and refine questions for the concept test.

- How can I use open-ended, non-leading questions to uncover genuine user feedback?
- What questions will encourage users to share their expectations, concerns, and motivations?
- How can I adapt the TEDW framework (tell, explain, describe, walk) to create insightful questions?

**Structure the interview guide:**

Guide me in organizing the questions into a logical flow.

- How should I start the session to set participants at ease and introduce the concept?
- What is the best way to transition between questions or topics?
- How can I leave room for follow-up questions or deeper exploration?

**Prepare for feedback and iteration:**

Help me think through how to handle and prioritize participant feedback.

- How can I encourage honest and constructive input?
- What steps can I take to synthesize feedback effectively after the sessions?

## **Reflection and refinement:**

Help me evaluate whether the interview guide is ready for use:

- Does it cover all the critical areas needed to evaluate the concept?
- Are the questions clear, unbiased, and likely to elicit actionable insights?
- Have I created enough flexibility in the guide to follow up on unexpected findings?

Please guide me step-by-step to brainstorm and refine questions for the concept test and create an interview guide that is clear, engaging, and aligned with my research goals.”

## **Follow-up prompts:**

- “Suggest additional questions to explore user perceptions of the concept.”
- “Help me draft a script for introducing the concept during the interview.”
- “Propose strategies for analyzing feedback from the concept test.”
- “Create a checklist for testing the guide with a colleague or pilot participant.”
- “Help me prioritize themes or areas to focus on during the test based on my goals.”
