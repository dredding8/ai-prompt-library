I need help preparing for a senior user research interview. Act as a thought partner to help me select strong project examples, practice articulating my impact, and frame my experience in a way that highlights strategic thinking, leadership, and influence. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**1. Interview context:**

- What kind of role or team are you interviewing with?

[Insert, e.g., “A senior UXR role embedded in a B2B platform team.”]

- What areas do you want to highlight most in the interview?

[Insert, e.g., “Cross-functional collaboration and turning research into roadmap shifts.”]

- What parts of interviewing make you feel the most unsure or stuck?

[Insert, e.g., “Framing my impact at a higher level, or tying my work to business outcomes.”]

**2. Choose strong examples**

Help me identify 2–3 projects that showcase my range.

- Which examples best reflect strategic thinking, not just tactical execution?

- What did I learn, influence, or change through this work?

**4. Practice framing for senior-level expectations**

Help me step up the way I talk about my work.

- How do I show that I think beyond research to product and business impact?

**6. Refine my delivery**

Guide me in polishing how I tell these stories.

- What’s a clean, 2–3 minute version of each example?
- How do I balance structure with sounding natural and confident?

**7. Reflection and refinement**

Help me assess whether I’m ready to shine in the interview.
