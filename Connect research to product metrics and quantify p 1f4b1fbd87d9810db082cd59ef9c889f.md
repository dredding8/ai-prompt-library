# Connect research to product metrics and quantify potential impact

Category: Impact, Stakeholder management
Information needed?: Information needed

## **Context:**

Understanding which product metrics your research influences is critical for demonstrating its value and aligning with business goals. This prompt helps you identify key metrics, connect them to your research objectives, and estimate the potential quantitative impact of your findings.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM and follow the steps to connect your research to product metrics and assign measurable impact.

“I need help identifying which product metrics my research will impact and estimating the potential improvement it might drive. Guide me step-by-step through this process.

**Define the research objectives and scope:**

- What is the focus of the research?
    - Example: “Understand why users abandon the checkout process.”
- What product decision or change will this research influence?
    - Example: “Redesign the checkout flow to reduce drop-off rates and increase conversion rates.”

**Identify the key product metrics:**

Which product metrics are directly tied to the research scope and objectives? List 2-4 metrics that are relevant to the research.

- Metric 1: [Insert, e.g., “Conversion rate: Percentage of users completing a purchase.”]
- Metric 2: [Insert, e.g., “Drop-off rate: Percentage of users who leave before completing checkout.”]
- Metric 3 (if applicable): [Insert, e.g., “Average time spent on checkout page.”]

**Connect research findings to metric impact:**

For each metric, describe how your research insights could influence it.

Example:

- Metric: “Conversion rate”
- Connection: “If we reduce friction in the payment process, more users will complete purchases, increasing the conversion rate.”
- Metric: “Drop-off rate”
- Connection: “Identifying pain points in the checkout process can help prioritize fixes that lower abandonment rates.”

**Estimate potential improvements:**

Using existing benchmarks or past data, estimate the potential impact of addressing the issues identified by your research.

Example:

“Current drop-off rate is 60%. Based on insights from similar studies, improving clarity in the payment flow could reduce this to 45%, resulting in a 15% improvement.”

If specific data is unavailable, suggest ways to gather baseline numbers for realistic estimates.

## Reflection questions:

- Are these metrics the most relevant for the stakeholders or team implementing changes?
- How confident am I in the connection between research insights and metric improvements?
- What assumptions am I making about the scale of the impact, and how can I test them?
- Am I considering any secondary metrics that could be affected by the same changes (e.g., customer satisfaction, task completion time)?
- Do I need additional data to quantify the baseline or validate the potential improvement?

Please expand this into a clear, actionable framework for linking my research to product metrics and estimating the quantitative impact.”

## **Follow-Up Prompts:**

1. “Draft a stakeholder-facing summary showing how the research findings will impact the identified metrics.”
2. “Suggest a method to validate the estimated improvement once changes are implemented.”
3. “What risks or trade-offs should I communicate about focusing on these metrics?”
4. “Create a prioritization framework to rank the metrics by importance and feasibility of impact.”
5. “Write a short explanation of how to track changes in the metrics over time to evaluate success.”
