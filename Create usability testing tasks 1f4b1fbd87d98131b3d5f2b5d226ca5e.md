Information needed?: Some information needed

## **Context:**

Designing usability testing tasks can be challenging, especially when trying to balance clarity, relevance, and alignment with research goals. This prompt acts as a thought partner, helping you brainstorm and refine tasks tailored to your study, without pre-answering questions, so the process feels collaborative and supportive.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help creating usability testing tasks.

“I’m stuck on creating usability testing tasks and need help brainstorming and refining tasks that align with my research goals and the product being tested. Act as a thought partner and guide me step-by-step through the process, offering tailored suggestions and prompts. Here’s some context to help generate more relevant guidance:

**Project context:**

- What product, feature, or experience is being tested?

[Insert details, e.g., “We are testing a new checkout flow in an e-commerce app.”]

- What are the primary research goals?

[Insert goals, e.g., “We want to identify usability issues that cause drop-offs during the checkout process.”]

- Who are the participants for this study?

[Insert details, e.g., “Frequent online shoppers aged 25-45.”]

**Define the purpose of the tasks:**

Help me clarify the purpose of the usability testing tasks.

- How can I ensure the tasks align with my research goals?
- What questions should I ask myself to focus on the most critical areas of the product or feature?

**Identify real-world scenarios:**

Help me brainstorm realistic scenarios that participants might encounter when using the product.

- What strategies can I use to ensure the tasks feel natural and representative of actual user behavior?
- How can I incorporate participant context (e.g., motivations or goals) into the task design?

**Craft clear and actionable tasks:**

Guide me in writing tasks that are clear, unbiased, and actionable.

- What steps can I take to ensure tasks are easy to understand without leading participants?
- How can I balance specificity with open-endedness to allow for genuine participant behavior?

**Sequence the tasks effectively:**

Help me determine the order in which tasks should be presented.

- How can I ensure the sequence feels logical and avoids overwhelming participants?
- What strategies can I use to avoid introducing bias between tasks?

## **Reflect and refine:**

Help me evaluate and improve the tasks I’ve created.

- Have I included enough detail to ensure participants understand what to do?
- Are the tasks designed to uncover the insights I need while minimizing bias?
- Are there any gaps or redundant tasks I should address?

Please act as a thought partner, encouraging reflection and guiding me through this process step-by-step, based on the context I’ve provided.”

## **Follow-up prompts:**

- “Suggest tools or templates to help structure and document the tasks.”
- “Propose ways to pilot the tasks to ensure clarity and relevance.”
- “Help me craft task instructions that minimize bias while encouraging natural behavior.”
- “Draft a script for introducing and facilitating the tasks during the session.”
- “Provide a checklist for reviewing tasks to ensure they align with research goals.”
