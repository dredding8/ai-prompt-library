# Brainstorm Team-Level OKRs

Prompt: Act as a veteran product leader for <product>.

Analyze the current company objectives.

Next, brainstorm three suggested Objective and Key Results (OKR) sets for a product team responsible for <product area>. Make sure those OKRs are aligned with company-wide objectives.

Remember that the two ingredients ok OKRs are:
• Objective - A qualitative, inspirational goal for a team to focus on.
• Key Results - Quantitative metrics (typically three) that monitor progress towards the Objective.

For example:
• Objective: Delight new users with the onboarding flow
• Key results:
    ◦ Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) >= 75%.
    ◦ 66%+ onboardings completed within two days.
    ◦ An average Time to Value (TTV) <= 20 minutes.
