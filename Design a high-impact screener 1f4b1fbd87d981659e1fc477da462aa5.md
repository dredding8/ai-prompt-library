# Design a high-impact screener

Category: Recruitment
Information needed?: Information needed

## **Context:**

A strong screener ensures you recruit participants who fit your needs while filtering out those who don’t. This prompt helps you build an effective screener with thoughtful reflection so you’re confident in the results.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM. Fill in the blanks as you go, and let the reflection questions refine your screener further.

“I’m creating a screener to recruit participants who [target audience description, e.g., ‘use fitness apps 3+ times a week’]. Help me write a screener that filters for ideal participants:

## **Define my participant profile**:

- Key behaviors/experiences: [Insert, e.g., ‘regular app usage’].
- Key demographics (if relevant): [Insert age, region, role, etc.].

## **Turn the profile into 3-5 clear questions**:

- Behavioral Question: ‘How often do you [target activity]?’
    - Options: Never / Monthly / Weekly / Daily
- Eliminator Question:’ Which of these best describes your familiarity with [X topic/tool]?’
    - Options: No experience / Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced
- Open-ended Question: ‘Tell us about the last time you [relevant action, e.g., tried a new app].’

## **Reflection questions:**

- Are my questions specific enough to identify ideal participants?
- Am I avoiding leading questions or giving away the “right” answer?
- Are my questions clear enough so people can’t misinterpret them?
- Am I missing any obvious questions to get the right participants?

Provide a polished screener that includes my questions, response options, and a brief introduction for participants.”

## **Follow-up prompts:**

1. “Test this screener by simulating responses. What feedback would you give to improve it?”
2. “Summarize the final screener into a format I can share.”
