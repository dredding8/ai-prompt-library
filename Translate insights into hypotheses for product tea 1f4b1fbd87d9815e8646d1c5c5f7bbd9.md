# Translate insights into hypotheses for product teams

Category: Planning, Stakeholder management
Information needed?: Some information needed

**Context:**

You’ve surfaced meaningful user insights—but now your team needs to do something with them. This prompt helps you turn those insights into testable, product-aligned hypotheses that guide what gets built, tested, or improved next.

**Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help turning research insights into hypotheses for your product team.

I need help translating research insights into product hypotheses that are clear, actionable, and aligned with what the team is trying to build or test. Act as a thought partner to guide me step-by-step in structuring strong hypotheses, linking them back to user needs, and making them usable for design, product, or experimentation. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**1. Project context:**

- **What was the research about?**

[Insert details, e.g., “Why users don’t complete the profile setup process.”]

- **What are some of the key insights from the research?**

[Insert a few themes, e.g., “Users don’t understand the value of completing their profile; the language feels too ‘salesy.’”]

- **What kind of team decisions will this inform?**

[Insert, e.g., “Upcoming design iterations and a potential A/B test for the onboarding flow.”]

**Guide me through writing hypotheses from insights:**

**2. Revisit the insight and its implications:**

Help me unpack what each insight is telling us.

- What unmet need, friction point, or motivator does this insight reveal?
- What change or solution might address that need?

**3. Write a first-pass hypothesis:**

Help me frame a hypothesis using a clear, testable format.

- How can I structure it as: *If we do X, we believe Y will happen because Z*?
- How do I keep it focused on one variable and one outcome?

**4. Make it user-centered and measurable:**

Guide me in making the hypothesis grounded and usable.

- How can I tie it directly to a user behavior or outcome?
- What signs of success or failure should we look for?

**5. Link it to product decisions or experiments:**

Help me clarify how this hypothesis could inform next steps.

- Is this something we can test with a design iteration, A/B test, or follow-up study?
- What constraints should we consider (e.g., dev time, data availability)?

**6. Write alternative or follow-up hypotheses:**

Guide me in expanding or branching out the thinking.

- What’s a second way of framing the same insight?
- What’s a “what if we’re wrong” version of the hypothesis?

**7. Reflection and refinement:**

Help me check whether the hypotheses are clear and valuable:

- Are they grounded in research, not assumptions?
- Are they usable by the team to move forward with building or testing?
- Are they focused and not trying to solve too many things at once?

Please guide me step-by-step to turn research insights into strong product hypotheses that help the team focus, test, and build with more confidence.

**Follow-up prompts:**

- Help me rewrite vague hypotheses into clearer, testable versions
- Suggest ways to prioritize which hypotheses to test first
- Draft a hypothesis summary to include in a research-to-design handoff
- Propose strategies to co-create hypotheses with product and design leads
- Help me track outcomes or learnings tied to each hypothesis we’ve tested
