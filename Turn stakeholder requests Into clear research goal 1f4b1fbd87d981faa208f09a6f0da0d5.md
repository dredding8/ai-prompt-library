# Turn stakeholder requests Into clear research goals

Category: Planning
Information needed?: Some information needed

## **Context:**

Stakeholders often come with broad, vague, or conflicting requests. This prompt helps you turn their input into a set of focused, actionable research goals that align with their needs and can guide your project effectively.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this structure into your LLM. Fill in the blanks and use the thought-partner questions to clarify and refine your goals.

“I’m working with stakeholders who have requested research around [brief description of stakeholder request, e.g., ‘understanding why users abandon the checkout flow’]. Help me turn this request into clear, actionable research goals:

## **Summarize stakeholder priorities**:

- What do the stakeholders say they want to learn?
    - Example: ‘Why are users dropping off at checkout?’

## **Identify the underlying need**:

- What decision or action will this research inform?
    - Example: ‘To improve checkout and reduce cart abandonment rates.’

## **Break down broad questions into specific research goals**:

- Rewrite stakeholder questions into 2-3 focused goals:
    - Goal 1: [e.g., Identify the main user frustrations in the checkout process.]
    - Goal 2: [e.g., Understand what motivates users to complete or abandon checkout.]

## **Reflection questions**:

- Are these goals specific and answerable through research?
- Do these goals align with stakeholder priorities and timelines?
- Are there any implicit assumptions in the stakeholder requests that I need to clarify?
- What’s at risk if I don’t address these goals? What happens if I do?
- How can I evaluate that these goals align with the most pressing user or business needs?
- Is there anything the stakeholder hasn’t asked for but should be included in the research?

## **Output a research goal summary**:

Write 1-2 sentences summarizing the goals:

- ‘The research will focus on [insert goals] to help stakeholders [insert action or decision, e.g., prioritize feature improvements in the checkout flow].’

Please expand this into a clear list of research goals, ensuring they are actionable and aligned with stakeholder needs.”

## **Follow-up prompts:**

1. “What assumptions might stakeholders have that could bias the research? Suggest ways to challenge or validate these assumptions.”
2. “Draft a short stakeholder update to confirm these research goals and ensure alignment before moving forward.”
3. “Tie these goals directly into business outcomes my stakeholders would care about.”
4. “Draft a set of clarifying questions to ask stakeholders in a kickoff meeting to confirm priorities.”
5. “Create a short visual (e.g., a flowchart or roadmap) to show how research goals will support business outcomes.”
6. “Write a concise research proposal email to confirm alignment with stakeholders before starting.”
7. “Identify where stakeholder goals might conflict and suggest ways to prioritize or balance them.”
