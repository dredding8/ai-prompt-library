# Plan a 3-month roadmap that aligns research with product goals

Category: Planning, Stakeholder management
Information needed?: Information needed

**Context:**

Quarterly planning helps ensure that research is proactive, intentional, and aligned with cross-functional team priorities. This prompt helps user researchers step back, synthesize what’s most important, and create a flexible, focused roadmap that supports key decisions and initiatives over the next three months.

**Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help building a quarterly user research roadmap.

I need help creating a quarterly research roadmap that outlines my top priorities and aligns with what my team needs most over the next 3 months. Act as a thought partner to guide me step-by-step in identifying research needs, scoping them into projects, and sequencing them realistically. Assume I’m starting from scratch. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**1. Organizational context:**

- **What teams or product areas are you supporting this quarter?**

[Insert details, e.g., “Platform team and core product team.”]

- **What product or business priorities are driving this quarter?**

[Insert details, e.g., “Launching a new AI-powered feature and improving user retention.”]

- **What constraints do you need to work around?**

[Insert details, e.g., “Limited bandwidth—only one researcher on the team this quarter.”]

**Guide me through building the roadmap:**

**2. Identify key research questions and gaps:**

Help me define the most important research opportunities.

- What decisions need to be made in the next 1–3 months that would benefit from research?
- What questions are still unanswered from previous projects?
- Where are stakeholders operating on assumptions instead of data?

**3. Scope potential research projects:**

Guide me in shaping these opportunities into clearly defined projects.

- What would each project aim to uncover or support?
- Which methods or approaches would make sense for each one?
- Are any of these candidates for mixed methods or secondary research?

**4. Prioritize and sequence projects:**

Help me organize these projects into a manageable timeline.

- What criteria should I use to prioritize? (e.g., urgency, impact, effort)
- How can I balance strategic vs. tactical work across the quarter?
- Are there opportunities to combine or sequence related studies?

**5. Plan for collaboration and visibility:**

Guide me in setting up touchpoints with stakeholders and sharing progress.

- What cadence should I set for check-ins or readouts?
- How can I share this roadmap in a way that’s transparent and invites input?

**6. Reflection and refinement:**

Help me ensure the roadmap is practical and aligned.

- Does the plan reflect the most pressing needs of the product team?
- Is it realistic based on the time and resources available?
- What built-in flexibility do I need in case priorities shift?

Please guide me step-by-step to build a quarterly research roadmap that supports decision-making, aligns with team goals, and is realistic to execute.

**Follow-up prompts:**

- Help me turn this roadmap into a visual format to share with stakeholders
- Draft a one-pager that summarizes the research priorities for this quarter
- Suggest ways to revisit and update the roadmap as things shift
- Create a template I can reuse every quarter for planning
- Propose strategies for getting stakeholder buy-in and feedback early
