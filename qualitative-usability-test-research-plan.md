# Qualitative usability test research plan

Category: Planning
Information needed?: Information needed

## **Context:**

Qualitative usability tests are ideal for uncovering user behaviors, pain points, and why something works—or doesn’t. This prompt will help you create a plan for 1:1 moderated sessions to collect rich, exploratory insights.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM, and fill in the placeholders as you go:

“I need help planning a qualitative usability test to evaluate [describe the product/feature]. Follow these steps to create a structured plan that uncovers deep user insights:

## **Define my goals**:

- What do I need to learn?
    - Example: ‘How do users navigate [X feature]?’ or ‘What pain points do users encounter when completing [Y task]?’

## **Identify participants**:

- Who are the target participants?
    - Example: Users aged [X-Y] who [specific behavior or experience].

## **Design participant tasks**:

1. Task 1: [Insert specific user task, e.g., ‘Find a product using the search bar.’]
2. Task 2: [Insert next task].

## **Prepare the facilitator guide**:

- Introduction: ‘Thank you for joining today. I’ll ask you to complete a few tasks and share your thoughts as you go.’
- During tasks, use open-ended questions:
    - Talk me through something that you notice is missing about this experience
        - Explain why [missing thing] is important to you
        - How have you used [missing thing] in your past experience?
    - Describe something that you notice that is confusing about this experience
        - Explain what makes it confusing
        - Talk me through a recent, similar experience that wasn’t confusing

## **Metrics to capture**:

- Observations: Where do users struggle or succeed?
- Verbatim feedback: Note user quotes that highlight frustrations or “aha” moments.

## **Reflection questions:**

- Will these tasks help me understand the “why” behind user behaviors?
- Are my questions open-ended enough to uncover unexpected insights?
- What questions might I be missing that would get us actionable information?

## **Next steps**:

Organize the test into a structured plan with goals, tasks, and a facilitator script. Please expand this into a full qualitative usability testing plan, ensuring it’s easy to follow and ready for moderation.”

## **Follow-up prompts:**

1. “What are the top 3 post-test questions I should ask participants to clarify their feedback?”
2. “What pushback might my stakeholders have on this plan?”
3. “What questions did the test leave unanswered, and how can I address those gaps? Provide suggestions for follow-up research methods (e.g., quantitative validation, further interviews).”
4. “If stakeholders question the findings, how can I validate or expand on this qualitative research? Suggest a plan for mixed-method research or additional evidence gathering.”
