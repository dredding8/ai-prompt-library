“I need help turning research insights into actionable recommendations for a product team. Act as a thought partner to guide me step-by-step through organizing insights, identifying actionable outcomes, and framing recommendations effectively. Assume I’m starting from insights that are not yet structured or aligned with product goals. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**Project context:**

- What product, feature, or experience does the research focus on?

[Insert details, e.g., “Improving the checkout flow in our e-commerce app.”]

- What are the primary insights or themes from the research?

[Insert initial insights, e.g., “Users find the payment options confusing and abandon the process.”]

- What goals or priorities does the product team have?

[Insert product team goals, e.g., “Reduce checkout abandonment and improve user satisfaction.”]

**Review and prioritize insights:**

Help me ensure I understand and organize the key findings from the research.

- What criteria should I use to prioritize which insights are most critical?
- How can I connect these insights directly to product team goals or pain points?

**Identify actionable opportunities:**

Guide me in translating insights into opportunities for improvement.

- What questions should I ask to uncover actionable steps from each insight?
- How can I propose solutions that are feasible for the team to implement?

**Craft clear and specific recommendations:**

Help me frame recommendations so they are clear, actionable, and aligned with team goals.

- What structure should I use to write each recommendation (e.g., “Insight → Opportunity → Recommendation”)?
- How can I ensure recommendations are specific enough to be implemented without being prescriptive?

**Prioritize recommendations:**

Guide me in prioritizing the recommendations for the team.

- What criteria (e.g., impact, feasibility, alignment with goals) should I use to decide which recommendations to focus on?
- How can I communicate the rationale for prioritization to stakeholders?

**Present recommendations effectively:**

Help me create a clear and compelling way to present the recommendations to the product team.

- What format or tools (e.g., slides, reports, visuals) should I use?
- How can I frame the recommendations to foster collaboration and buy-in?

## **Reflection questions:**

Help me ensure the recommendations are impactful and aligned with the team’s needs:

- Are the recommendations grounded in the research insights?
- Have I framed them in a way that highlights their value to the product team?
- Are there any gaps or additional opportunities I might have missed?

Please guide me step-by-step to create actionable and prioritized recommendations based on the research insights, providing tailored suggestions based on the context I’ve shared.”

**Follow-up prompts:**

- “Help me draft a summary of the recommendations to share with stakeholders.”

•	“Suggest ways to evaluate these recommendations with the product team or additional research.”

- “Propose strategies for measuring the impact of the implemented recommendations.”
- “Draft a plan for communicating these recommendations to non-technical or cross-functional teams.”
- “Suggest ways to refine recommendations based on team feedback or constraints.”
