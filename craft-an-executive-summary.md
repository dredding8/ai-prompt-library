## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM and follow the steps to create a compelling executive summary.

“I need help creating an impactful executive summary from my research insights. Guide me through the process of structuring and crafting a summary that clearly communicates key findings and actionable recommendations to stakeholders.

**Define the audience and purpose:**

- Who is the audience for this executive summary?
    - Example: “Senior executives and product managers.”
- What decisions or actions should this summary inform?
    - Example: “Prioritize design improvements to address user pain points.”

**Structure the executive summary:**

1. **Opening Statement (Context):** Provide a brief introduction to the research:
- “What was the purpose of this research?”
    - Example: “This research aimed to understand why users abandon the checkout process and identify opportunities for improvement.”
- “Why is this research important?”
    - Example: “Improving the checkout flow can reduce drop-offs and increase conversions by 15%.”
1.  **Key Insights (Themes):** Highlight 2-4 major insights with supporting evidence:
- Insight 1: [Insert, e.g., “Users find the payment step confusing due to unclear error messages.”]
    - Evidence: “60% of participants mentioned confusion at this step, with 30% unable to complete the process.”
- Insight 2: [Insert, e.g., “Users expect faster load times during checkout.”]
    - Evidence: “Session recordings showed a 45% drop-off rate for pages with load times over 5 seconds.”
1. **Recommendations:** For each insight, provide 1-2 actionable recommendations:
- Insight: “Users find the payment step confusing.”
    - Recommendation: “Simplify error messages with specific instructions to help users resolve issues quickly.”
- Insight: “Users expect faster load times.”
    - Recommendation: “Optimize page performance to reduce load times to under 3 seconds.”
1.  **Business Impact:**

Link recommendations to measurable outcomes:

- Example: “Implementing these recommendations is projected to reduce checkout drop-offs by 20%, increasing revenue by $X per month.”

## Reflection questions:

- Are the insights and recommendations aligned with stakeholder priorities?
- Does the summary focus on high-impact findings while staying concise?
- Have I clearly communicated the business implications of the recommendations?
- Is the language accessible and free of jargon to ensure clarity for all stakeholders?
- Are there any gaps in the summary that might leave stakeholders with unanswered questions?

Please expand this into a polished executive summary that highlights the key findings, actionable recommendations, and their potential business impact.”

## **Follow-Up Prompts:**

- “Suggest metrics or KPIs stakeholders can use to measure the success of implementing these recommendations.”
