“I need help creating a user journey map. Guide me step-by-step to structure the map, define stages, and visualize user actions, emotions, and opportunities based on my research. Highlight where I need to provide inputs to customize the map for my project.

**Define the user journey:**

- What process, task, or experience does this journey map represent?
    - Example: The process of onboarding a new user to our app.
- What is the starting point?
    - Example: User learns about the app and downloads it.
- What is the endpoint?
    - Example: User successfully completes onboarding and explores features.

**Break the journey into stages:**

Help me define the key stages or phases of this journey. Use my research data to identify major steps. Example:

- Awareness: Discovering the app.
- Consideration: Deciding to sign up.
- Onboarding: Creating an account and completing setup.
- Engagement: Using the app’s features for the first time.

**Identify key elements for each stage:**

For each stage, include:

- User actions: What is the user doing at this stage?
    - Example: Signing up, setting preferences, or skipping optional steps.
- Emotions: How does the user feel at this stage?
    - Example: Excited, confused, or frustrated by unclear instructions.
- Pain points: What challenges might the user face?
    - Example: Difficulty understanding setup instructions.
- Opportunities: What improvements could be made to address user challenges?
    - Example: Add contextual help for each onboarding step.

**Visualize the journey map:**

Provide preferences for how you’d like to visualize the journey.

- Would you prefer a horizontal layout with stages listed in order, or a vertical structure?
- What tools will you use to create the map? (e.g., Figma, Miro, Excel)?

## **Reflection questions:**

- Have I included all major stages of the journey?
- Do the actions, emotions, and pain points accurately reflect the user data?
- Are the opportunities specific and aligned with the research goals?
- Does the map clearly communicate the user experience to stakeholders?

Please provide a step-by-step guide for creating this journey map, including suggestions for structuring and visualizing it based on the inputs I provided.”

## **Follow-up prompts:**

- Suggest tools and templates to organize the journey map.
- Provide examples of how to document emotions and pain points effectively.
- Draft a summary explanation to present the journey map to stakeholders.
- Suggest additional stages or elements I may have missed.
- Help refine opportunities into specific, actionable and business-based recommendations.
