Business Model Canvas

For example, if you're developing a clothing brand, your key partners might include textile suppliers and manufacturers.

2. Key Activities

Describe the key activities that your business performs to create value for your customers. This might include product development, marketing, or customer support.

For example, if you're developing a software application, your key activities might include coding, customer support, and customer success.

3. Key Resources

Identify the key resources that your business needs to operate successfully. This might include physical resources such as equipment and technology, as well as talented people.

For example, if you're developing a hardware product, your “key resources” might include engineers, product managers, and designers.

4. Value Propositions

Clearly articulate the value that your business provides to your customers. What problems does it solve? This might also include affordability, convenience, or superior quality.

For example, if you're developing a meal kit delivery service, your value proposition might be the convenience of having healthy meals delivered straight to your door.

5. Customer Relationships

7. Customer Segments
