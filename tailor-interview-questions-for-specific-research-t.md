# Tailor interview questions for specific research types

Category: Methods, Planning
Information needed?: Information needed

## **Context:**

Different types of interviews—like Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD), journey mapping, or observational sessions such as “walk the store”—require distinct styles of questioning. This prompt provides clear, actionable suggestions for crafting appropriate questions tailored to each interview type.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM and use it to craft tailored questions for different types of interviews.

“I need help creating interview questions tailored to different interview types. These questions should align with the purpose of each format (e.g., JTBD, journey mapping, walk-the-store observation) and encourage open-ended, meaningful responses. Use these steps to generate wording suggestions.

**Define the interview type:**

- What type of interview am I conducting?
    - Example: Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD), journey mapping, or walk-the-store observation.
- What is the goal of this interview type?
    - Example: “For JTBD, I want to uncover what job the user is hiring the product for.”

**Provide sample questions for the selected interview type:**

**Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD):**

Focus on understanding the user’s goals and motivations.

- “What situation made you realize you needed [product/service]?”
- “What alternatives did you consider before deciding on this?”
- “What specific outcome were you hoping to achieve when you chose [product/service]?”
- “How does this product help you get [desired job] done better than other options?”

**Journey Mapping:**

Explore the user’s experience over time, step by step.

- “Can you walk me through the process of [specific task, e.g., booking a flight]?”
- “What was the most challenging part of that experience?”
- “At which points did you feel the most frustration or confusion?”
- “What could have made the process smoother or more enjoyable?”

**Walk-the-Store Observation:**

Capture behaviors, decisions, and challenges in a real-world environment.

- “What’s the first thing you notice when you enter [store/environment]?”
- “How do you typically decide what to buy in this section?”
- “Can you show me how you find what you’re looking for?”
- “Are there areas in the store that you tend to avoid or find difficult to navigate? Why?”

Please generate a full list of tailored, open-ended questions for the selected interview type to ensure they align with the research objectives.”

## Reflection questions:

- Are these questions aligned with the unique goals of the selected interview type?
- Do they encourage participants to share detailed, thoughtful responses?
- Are they free of assumptions or leading language?
- Do they match the participant’s context and avoid jargon?

## **Follow-Up Prompts:**

- “Write a brief introduction script for each interview type to set expectations and build participant comfort.”
- “Suggest ways to adapt these questions for time-limited interviews while maintaining depth.”
- “Provide tips for probing further if participants give vague or surface-level responses.”
- “Draft a follow-up script for after the interview to confirm insights or ask clarifying questions.”
- “Suggest variations of these questions for remote or virtual interviews.”
