**Context:**

Starting a research project can feel overwhelming, especially when defining goals, methods, and deliverables. This prompt provides structured guidance to help you clarify your objectives, choose methods, and create a roadmap for their project, even if you’re unsure where to begin.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help starting your research project.

“I’m feeling stuck on how to start a research project. Guide me step-by-step to define my goals, plan methods, and outline next steps. Assume I have limited clarity and need practical suggestions at each stage. Please provide ideas and examples where necessary to help me get started.

**Clarify the research goals:**

I’m not sure what the specific goals of this project should be. Suggest ways to identify what I’m trying to learn or achieve. How can I align these goals with stakeholder needs or business objectives?

**Identify the key research questions:**

Help me brainstorm questions that align with the goals. What are effective strategies for transforming high-level objectives into actionable research questions?

**Select appropriate methods:**

What methods should I consider based on my goals and research questions? Offer ideas for both qualitative and quantitative approaches, and explain when each might be useful.

**Plan participant recruitment:**

I’m unsure about the types of participants I need. Suggest ways to identify and recruit the right people for this study. How can I define inclusion and exclusion criteria without over-filtering?
