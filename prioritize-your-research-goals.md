Category: Planning
Information needed?: Some information needed

## **Context:**

When starting a new research project, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed by competing goals and unclear priorities. This prompt helps you clarify what matters most and ensures your project focuses on high-impact outcomes.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM and work through the steps to prioritize effectively. Use the thought-partner reflections to catch gaps and build a sharper plan.

“I’m starting a user research project for [brief description, e.g., improving onboarding for a new app]. Help me clarify my goals and prioritize them:

## **Brainstorm my goals**:

- List 5-7 things I hope to learn:
    - Example: Understand user pain points with [X feature], identify motivations for [Y behavior].

## **Rank my goals by impact and feasibility**:

For each goal, rank:

- High Impact / Easy Feasibility
- High Impact / Hard Feasibility
- Low Impact / Hard Feasibility

## **Reflection questions:**

- Which 2-3 goals will provide the most immediate value to stakeholders?
- If I could only focus on one goal, what would it be and why?

## **Output summary**:

Write a 1-2 sentence focus:

‘The primary focus of this research is to [insert top goals] to [stakeholder outcome, e.g., inform design or prioritize roadmap].’

Please organize this into a clean, prioritized list and concise summary.”

## **Follow-up prompts:**

1. “What goals might I be missing that might be better aligned for the project?”
2. “Now that I’ve prioritized my goals, recommend 2-3 research methods to address each one.”
3. “Turn this into a presentation summary I can share with stakeholders.”
