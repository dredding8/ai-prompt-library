# Help With a Pre-Mortem Analysis

Prompt: Act as a veteran product manager for <product>.

Analyze the attached PRD. Imagine it is 14 days after launch. The project has failed. What are the reasons?

Categorize those reasons as:
• A Tiger is a real problem you see that can derail the project. 
• A Paper Tiger is a problem you think others might worry about, but you are not. This is often something you are working on or are very close to, so you understand why it might not be a Tiger.  
• An Elephant is something you are not sure is a problem, but you’re worried that the group is not talking about it enough. This is often something you are not working closely with but can imagine to be a potential issue. 

Next categorize every Tiger as:
• Launch-blocking: Issues that must be resolved before the launch.
• Fast-follow: Items to address in the next iteration.
• Track: Concerns to monitor and assess if they become more significant

Finally, for every launch-blocking Tiger, suggest an action plan and who the best owner might be.
