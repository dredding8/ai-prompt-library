# Understand and apply the JTBD Four Forces Diagram

Category: Methods
Information needed?: Some information needed

## **Context:**

The jobs-to-be-done (JTBD) Four Forces Diagram is a powerful tool for understanding the factors driving or preventing users from adopting a product or service. This prompt helps you break down the framework, relate it to your research, and identify actionable insights to guide product decisions.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help understanding and applying the JTBD Four Forces Diagram to your research.

“I’m struggling to understand how the JTBD Four Forces Diagram applies to my research and how to use it effectively. Act as a thought partner to guide me step-by-step through understanding the framework, relating it to my research, and uncovering actionable insights. Assume I need help starting from scratch. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**Project context:**

- **What product, feature, or experience are you focusing on?**

[Insert details, e.g., “A subscription feature for a productivity app.”]

- **Who is your target audience?**

[Insert details, e.g., “Freelancers and small business owners managing multiple clients.”]

- **What are the research goals?**

[Insert goals, e.g., “To understand what motivates users to subscribe and what prevents them from doing so.”]

**Explain the Four Forces framework:**

Help me understand the components of the diagram and how they relate to user behavior.

- What are the four forces (push of the current situation, pull of the new solution, habits of the present, and anxiety of the future)?
- How do these forces interact to influence user decisions?

 ****

**Connect the forces to my research:**

Guide me in relating the four forces to the context of my research.

- How can I identify the “push” factors driving users to seek a solution?
- What strategies can I use to uncover the “pull” factors that attract users to my product?
- How can I explore the “habits” or routines that might hold users back from adopting the solution?
- What methods can I use to understand the “anxieties” or fears users have about making a change?

**Brainstorm research questions:**

Help me craft questions to explore each of the four forces in my research.

- How can I frame questions to uncover user motivations and pain points?
- What prompts can I use to encourage participants to share their anxieties or concerns?
- How can I ensure the questions are open-ended and unbiased?

**Analyze and map the findings:**

Guide me in organizing and synthesizing the research findings using the diagram.

- What steps should I take to map my data to the four forces?
- How can I identify patterns or insights that reveal the dynamics influencing user behavior?

**Apply the insights:**

Help me translate the findings into actionable recommendations for the product team.

- How can I prioritize addressing anxieties and breaking habits that prevent adoption?
- What strategies can I propose to amplify the push and pull factors driving adoption?

## **Reflection and refinement:**

Help me evaluate whether I’ve applied the Four Forces Diagram effectively:

- Have I captured all key motivations and barriers influencing user behavior?
- Does the analysis align with my research goals and provide actionable insights?
- What additional steps can I take to refine or evaluate the findings?

Please guide me step-by-step in understanding and applying the Four Forces Diagram to my research, ensuring the process is clear, actionable, and aligned with my project goals.”

## **Follow-up prompts:**

- “Help me craft a visual representation of the Four Forces Diagram based on my findings.”
- “Suggest ways to evaluate the identified forces with additional research or testing.”
- “Propose strategies to communicate the Four Forces insights to stakeholders effectively.”
- “Draft examples of how the product team can act on the insights from each force.”
- “Help me identify gaps or opportunities for further exploration within the framework.”
