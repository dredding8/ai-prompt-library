# Break down a large research question Into actionable parts

Category: Planning
Information needed?: Information needed

## **Context:**

Large research questions can feel overwhelming and impossible to tackle. This prompt helps you break big, broad questions into smaller, focused parts that can be addressed efficiently.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM and follow the structure to make progress on your research.

“I’m trying to answer the broad research question: [insert large research question, e.g., ‘How can we improve user satisfaction with our mobile app?’]. Help me break this into smaller, actionable parts:

## **Clarify the core components of the question**:

- What subtopics or themes are included?
    - Example: Usability, feature gaps, or user frustrations.

## **Write smaller research questions for each part**:

- Sub-question 1: [e.g., What are the top usability issues users experience?]
- Sub-question 2: [e.g., Which features do users find most or least useful?]

## **Reflection questions**:

- Are these smaller questions specific and answerable within the timeline?
- Do these parts address the original broad question effectively?
- Does this breakdown ensure I can address the broad question step-by-step? Are there gaps in my sub-questions?
- If one part of the research had to be deprioritized, which would it be and why?
- What methods align best with each sub-question to ensure efficient, actionable answers?
- Am I being specific enough in my sub-questions to avoid vague findings?

## **Prioritize the parts**:

- Which of these smaller questions will deliver the biggest impact?
- Which of these smaller questions would help stakeholders move forward with decisions?

## **Summarize the breakdown**:

- ‘To address [insert broad question], the research will focus on [list the smaller questions].’

Please expand this into a list of prioritized sub-questions ready for a structured research plan.”

## **Follow-up prompts:**

1. “Suggest the best research methods to address each of these smaller questions.”
2. “Write a timeline for answering these parts step by step.”
3. “Prioritize the sub-questions by importance and feasibility. Suggest which parts to tackle first.”
4. “Create a phased timeline for addressing the sub-questions, breaking them into deliverable milestones.”
5. “Write a summary for stakeholders showing how answering these smaller questions will lead to actionable insights.”
6. “What are the dependencies between these sub-questions, and how can I sequence the research to avoid delays?”
