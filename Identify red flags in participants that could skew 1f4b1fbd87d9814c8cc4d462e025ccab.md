# Identify red flags in participants that could skew data

Category: Recruitment
Information needed?: Some information needed

## **Context:**

Low-quality or misaligned participants can undermine your research and lead to misleading insights. This prompt helps you identify potential red flags during recruitment and create a strategy to address them—so you get reliable, actionable data from the right participants.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM and use the structure to develop a detailed plan for identifying and handling red flags.

“I’m recruiting participants for a research study on [describe research topic, e.g., ‘understanding how freelancers use time management tools’]. Help me identify red flags that could compromise data quality and develop a strategy for addressing them:

## **Define participant red flags**:

- List potential behaviors, responses, or traits that signal a participant might not be a good fit. Example:
    - Providing inconsistent or contradictory answers in the screener.
    - Speeding through the screener or answering every question with ‘Yes.’
    - Showing a lack of relevant experience during pre-screening (e.g., claims to use X tool but cannot describe it).
    - Providing overly generic or vague responses to open-ended questions.
    - Offering answers that suggest professional research participants (e.g., frequent participation in paid studies).

**Create red flag questions for the screener**:

Add specific questions to identify unreliable or low-quality participants:

- Behavioral verification:
    - “Can you tell me about the last time you used [X product or service]?”
    - Red flag: A participant cannot provide a clear or detailed answer.
- Open-ended response quality:
    - “Why did you start using [X tool or feature]?”
    - Red flag: Extremely short, non-thoughtful responses like ‘It’s useful.’
- Eliminate professional participants:
    - “How often do you participate in research studies?”
    - Red flag: Answers like ‘Weekly’ or ‘Every month.’

## **Validate participant responses before confirmation**:

Review responses carefully for:

- Consistency across related questions.
- Signs of rushed or careless answers.
- Level of detail that matches the participant profile.

If possible, schedule a short 5-10 minute pre-screening call:

- Ask 1-2 open-ended questions to confirm the participant’s fit.
    - Example: “Can you walk me through how you typically do [X task]?”

## **Reflection questions**:

- Are my screener questions designed to uncover these red flags without biasing participants?
- What’s the trade-off if I accidentally exclude someone who might provide valuable perspectives?
- Am I relying too much on demographics or missing behavioral red flags?
- Do I have a plan for replacing unfit participants without delaying the timeline?

## **Summarize my red flag strategy**:

Create a checklist to review each participant:

- Do their screener responses meet my quality standards?
- Are there any answers that suggest they are not a good fit?
- Did they provide thoughtful, consistent, and relevant responses?

Please format this into a clear plan that includes red flag identification, screening questions, and a participant review process to ensure high data quality.”

## **Follow-up prompts:**

1. “Suggest additional questions I can include in my screener to confirm participant fit while spotting potential red flags.”
2. “Create a short pre-screening script for a quick call to validate participants before including them in the study.”
3. “What strategies can I use to address last-minute dropouts or replacements of participants flagged as unsuitable?”
4. “How can I train my team to recognize red flags during recruitment and ensure consistency across screeners?”
5. “Summarize this red flag strategy into a 1-page checklist I can use to review participants quickly and effectively.”
