# Craft professional and engaging participant communication templates

Category: Recruitment
Information needed?: Starting from scratch

## **Context:**

Effective communication with participants is key to successful recruitment and maintaining engagement throughout the research process. This prompt helps you create tailored email or message templates for every stage of participant communication, from initial outreach to follow-ups and thank-yous.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM and use it to generate professional, clear, and engaging communication templates.

“I need help crafting participant communication templates for my research project. These templates should be tailored to specific stages of the research process (outreach, follow-up, confirmation, and thank-you) and formatted for email or messaging tools.

**Define the research context:**

- What type of research am I conducting?
    - Example: “Usability testing for a new app feature.”
- Who is the target participant group?
    - Example: “Adults aged 25-45 who use fitness tracking apps regularly.”

**Craft outreach messages:**

Write a clear, engaging message for recruiting participants. Include:

1. **Purpose:** Why is this research important, and why are participants being contacted?
    1. Example: “We’re conducting a usability study to improve [specific product/feature]. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us make it better for users like you.”
2. **Details:** What do participants need to know?
    1. Example: “The session will take approximately 45 minutes and will be conducted via Zoom.”
3. **Incentive:** What’s in it for the participant?
    1. Example: “Participants will receive a $50 gift card as a thank-you for their time.”
4. **Call-to-Action:** How can they sign up?
    1. Example: “If you’re interested, please complete this short screener: [link].”
5. **Subject lines:** Create several different subject lines that would increase open rates

**Draft follow-up and confirmation messages:**

1. **Follow-Up Message:** Use this to remind participants to respond if they haven’t already.

Example:

“Hi [Name],

Just a quick reminder that we’re still looking for participants for our usability study on [topic]. We’d love your feedback! Please complete this screener by [deadline]: [link].

Thank you!”

1. **Confirmation Message:** Send this once participants are selected.

Example:

“Hi [Name],

Thank you for signing up for our usability study! Here are the details for your session:

- **Date/Time:** [Insert details]
- **Location:** [Zoom link or address]
- **What to Bring:** [Insert, if applicable]

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. We look forward to hearing your thoughts!”

**Craft thank-you messages:**

Send these after the session to maintain a positive participant experience.

Example:

“Hi [Name],

Thank you so much for participating in our usability study! Your feedback was incredibly helpful and will directly impact how we improve [product/feature].

As a token of our appreciation, we’ve sent you a $50 gift card. Please let us know if you have any further thoughts or feedback to share.

Thanks again,

[Your Name/Team Name]”

## Reflection questions:

- Is the tone of the messages clear, professional, and engaging?
- Have I clearly communicated the purpose and value of the research?
- Are the instructions and details easy to follow for participants?
- Have I accounted for accessibility needs (e.g., clear language, visual clarity, multiple contact options)?
- Do the templates leave a positive impression to encourage future participation?

Please create outreach, follow-up, confirmation, and thank-you templates tailored to this research project.”

## **Follow-Up Prompts:**

- “Suggest ways to personalize these templates for different participant demographics.”
- “Write a troubleshooting template for handling common participant issues (e.g., rescheduling or tech difficulties).”
- “Create a script for phone or video outreach to complement email communication.”
- “Draft a message for participants who are not selected, thanking them for their time.”
- “Suggest a short post-session feedback request to improve future participant communication.”
