# Brainstorm a Product Vision

Prompt: Act as a veteran product leader for <product>.

Based on the attached information about our company and product, brainstorm a product vision.

Remember that the vision will motivate your teams to wake up every morning and go to work.

[Important] An effective vision needs to be:
• Inspiring: People who help to implement the vision should feel inspired and excited. And you don’t get inspired by chasing financial metrics.
• Achievable: It must have a decent chance of working. Don’t dream of traveling to Alpha Centauri until you send humans to Mars.
• Emotional: A vision becomes impactful and memorable when it resonates emotionally and inspires practical action.

Briefly explain your rationale.
