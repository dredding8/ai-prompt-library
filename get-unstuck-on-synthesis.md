## **Context:**

Synthesis is one of the most challenging stages of user research, requiring clarity, focus, and creativity to transform raw data into actionable insights. 

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help synthesizing your research findings.

“I’m feeling stuck on synthesizing my research data and need help organizing my thoughts, identifying patterns, and distilling meaningful insights. Act as a thought partner to guide me step-by-step through this process, offering tailored suggestions and prompting reflection where necessary. Here’s some context about my project to help generate more relevant guidance:

 **Project context:**

- What is this research about?

[Insert project details, e.g., “This research focuses on understanding pain points in our app’s onboarding process.”]

- What methods were used to collect data?

[Insert methods, e.g., “We conducted 10 semi-structured interviews and analyzed open-ended survey responses.”]

- What outcomes are expected from this synthesis?

[Insert outcomes, e.g., “We need to identify actionable recommendations to improve onboarding and reduce drop-off rates.”]

**Guide me through the synthesis process:**

**Clarify the synthesis goals:**

Guide me to refine the purpose of this synthesis process.

- How can I ensure the synthesis aligns with the goals of my research and stakeholder expectations?

**Organize the raw data:**

Help me structure and review my raw data effectively.

- What methods or tools can I use to sort and group my notes, transcripts, or observations?
- How can I approach the data to ensure I’m capturing both big-picture themes and granular details?

**Identify patterns and connections:**

Guide me in uncovering meaningful trends in the data.

- What questions should I ask myself to identify recurring patterns?
- How can I reconcile conflicting information or manage overwhelming data?

**Frame themes and insights:**

Help me distill patterns into clear, actionable insights.

- How do I ensure each theme is distinct and supported by evidence?
- What questions can I use to test whether an insight is meaningful and relevant?

**Prioritize findings:**

Guide me to prioritize themes or insights effectively.

- What criteria should I use to determine which findings are most impactful or actionable?
- How can I align prioritization with stakeholder needs and research goals?

**Reflect and refine:**

Help me reflect on the synthesis process to ensure I’ve captured the essence of the research.

- Have I accounted for all major patterns and outliers in the data?
- Are my insights actionable, aligned with my research goals, and meaningful to stakeholders?
- What adjustments can I make to improve clarity or focus?

Please tailor your responses based on the project context I’ve provided and guide me step-by-step to move from raw data to meaningful insights.”

**Follow-up prompts:**

- “Suggest tools or frameworks to help structure and visualize themes from my data.”
- “Create a checklist for validating the themes and insights I’ve identified.”
- “Propose ways to test whether my synthesized insights resonate with stakeholders.”
- “Draft a summary or narrative to present the findings in a clear and compelling way.”
- “Help me identify any gaps or areas where I might need further analysis.”
