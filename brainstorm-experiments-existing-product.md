# Brainstorm Experiments: Existing Product

Prompt: Act as an experienced product manager performing continuous product discovery for <product>.

The product trio suggested the following idea: <idea>.

And identified the following assumptions that need to be tested: <assumptions>.

First, suggest a set of easy experiments to test those assumptions before the engineers fully implement an idea (e.g., experiments involving user prototypes, such as first-click testing or a task to accomplish with a prototype, a feature stub, or a spike).

Limitations:
• Remember to measure the actual behavior, not users’ opinions.
• Test ideas responsibly without putting users or the business at risk. This is particularly important for testing on production (e.g., an A/B test). For each such test, explain how you will mitigate those risks.

Next, for each experiment, specify explicitly:
• What do we believe (assumption)?
• What exactly will we do to validate our assumption?
• A metric that will be measured.
• The expected value of the metric, if we are right.
