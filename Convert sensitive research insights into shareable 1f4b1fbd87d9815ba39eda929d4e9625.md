# Convert sensitive research insights into shareable case studies

Category: Career
Information needed?: Information needed

## **Context:**

When working with insights or case studies containing sensitive or confidential information, it’s essential to anonymize and generalize the data while preserving the impact of the findings. This prompt helps researchers transform their insights into a form that is shareable and meaningful without compromising confidentiality.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to turn confidential research insights into impactful, shareable findings.

“I need help transforming research insights and case studies that include sensitive or confidential information into generalized findings that can be shared while retaining their value. Guide me step-by-step through anonymizing and reframing these insights for a broader audience.

**Identify the core message:**

- What is the main takeaway or insight? Focus on the essence of the finding without referencing sensitive specifics. Example:
    - Original: “Users from [specific company] faced challenges navigating [proprietary system].”
    - Reframed: “Users faced significant navigation challenges in complex systems.”

**Remove identifiable details:**

Eliminate references to:

- Specific companies, partners, or organizations.
- Proprietary tools, methods, or systems.
- Unique identifiers, locations, or names.

Example:

- Original: “Participants from [City X] reported difficulty with [Feature Y].”
- Reframed: “Participants in urban environments reported difficulty with navigation features.”

**Generalize the context:**

- Replace specifics with broader, industry-relevant terms.
- Frame findings as general trends or insights applicable to a wider audience.

Example:

- Original: “Customers using [partner payment gateway] experienced delays.”
- Reframed: “Payment processing delays were reported across multiple gateways.”

**Neutralize the language:**

- Use neutral, objective phrasing to remove emotional or overly specific language.
- Frame findings as trends, challenges, or opportunities relevant to similar contexts.

Example:

- Original: “The system frequently crashed, frustrating users.”
- Reframed: “Frequent system crashes created challenges for users.”

**Highlight actionable outcomes:**

- Retain actionable recommendations and lessons learned.

Example:

- Original: “We recommend [specific tool upgrade] to address [client-specific challenge].”
- Reframed: “A system upgrade to enhance reliability and user experience is recommended.”

**Validate for confidentiality:**

Ensure no sensitive details remain by cross-checking:

- Are all company, product, and partner names removed?
- Are metrics or specifics generalized to avoid indirect identification?
- Does the insight remain actionable and meaningful?

**Reflection questions:**

- Is the core insight preserved after anonymization?
- Are the findings broad and neutral enough to avoid disclosing sensitive information?
- Could these insights be applied in other contexts or industries?

Please anonymize and generalize the research insights to ensure confidentiality while maintaining impact. Provide clear recommendations and summaries based on the transformed findings.”

**Follow-up prompts:**

- “Summarize these anonymized findings into a stakeholder-friendly report.”
- “Create a summary based on the generalized insights.”
- “Suggest ways to present these findings at an external event or in a blog.”
- “Provide a checklist for anonymizing future research findings.”
- “Write an external-friendly case study using the generalized data.”
