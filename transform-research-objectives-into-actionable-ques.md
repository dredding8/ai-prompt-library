# Transform research objectives into actionable questions and analysis plans

Category: Analysis, Planning
Information needed?: Information needed

## **Context:**

High-level research objectives can be overwhelming and hard to act on. This prompt helps you break them down into focused, actionable questions and create analysis plans that are clear, feasible, and directly tied to stakeholder needs.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM and follow the steps to turn your research objectives into actionable questions and analysis plans.

“I need help transforming high-level research objectives into specific, actionable research questions and a detailed analysis plan. Guide me step-by-step through this process.

**Define the high-level objectives**:

- What are the overarching goals of this research?
    - Example: “Understand why users abandon the checkout process.”
- What specific decisions or actions will this research inform?
    - Example: “Redesign the checkout flow to reduce drop-offs by 20%.”

**Break the objectives into actionable research questions:**

For each objective, create 2-4 focused research questions.

- Objective: [Insert objective, e.g., “Understand why users abandon checkout.”]
    - Research Question 1: [e.g., “What are the main reasons users leave during checkout?”]
    - Research Question 2: [e.g., “Which steps in the process cause confusion or frustration?”]
    - Research Question 3: [e.g., “What expectations do users have for the checkout experience?”]
    - Research Question 4 (optional): [e.g., “How does the current checkout flow compare to competitors?”]

**Refine the questions for clarity and relevance:**

- Are these questions specific enough to generate actionable insights?
- Are there any questions missing that would directly address the objectives?
- How do these questions align with stakeholder priorities?

**Match methods to each research question:**

For every research question, suggest 1-2 methods that will provide the best insights.

- Example for Research Question 1:
    - “What are the main reasons users leave during checkout?”
    - Method: Analyze drop-off rates using analytics and conduct post-purchase surveys to identify pain points.
- Example for Research Question 2:
    - “Which steps in the process cause confusion or frustration?”
    - Method: Run usability tests on the current checkout flow to observe participant behaviors.

Draft a clear analysis plan:

For each method, outline how the data will be analyzed and linked to the research goals.

Example for usability tests:

- Document key pain points observed during testing.
- Group findings into categories like “navigation issues” or “payment concerns.”

Example for surveys:

- Quantify user responses to identify the most frequent complaints.
- Cross-analyze demographic data to uncover specific group patterns.

## Reflection questions:

- Do the research questions and methods fully address the objectives and stakeholder needs?
- Are there opportunities to streamline the analysis plan without sacrificing quality?
- Am I accounting for potential biases in how questions are framed or methods are applied?
- What’s the single most important insight stakeholders need from this research, and is it fully covered?
- Have I chosen methods that match the timeline and available resources?
- Am I leaving room for unexpected insights or themes that might emerge during analysis?

Please expand this into a fully actionable research and analysis plan that connects high-level objectives to stakeholder-ready insights and decisions.”

## **Follow-Up Prompts:**

- “Create a prioritization matrix for the research questions based on impact and feasibility.”
- “Draft a stakeholder-facing overview of the objectives, questions, and methods for sign-off.”
- “Suggest ways to validate findings with a secondary method to ensure robustness.”
- “Write a simple visual framework to map questions to methods and expected outputs.”
- “What risks or gaps might arise in this research plan, and how can they be mitigated?”
