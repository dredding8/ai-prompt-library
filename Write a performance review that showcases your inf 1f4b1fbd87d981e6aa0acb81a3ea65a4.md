I need help writing a performance review that clearly shows the impact of my work this past cycle. Act as a thought partner to help me reflect on my key contributions, organize them into themes, and write about them in a way that highlights leadership, influence, and strategic thinking. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**1. Role context:**

- What is your role and level?

[Insert, e.g., “Senior UX researcher embedded in a cross-functional team.”]

- What’s the time period you’re reflecting on?

[Insert, e.g., “The last 6 months.”]

- What do you want to be recognized for or move toward in your career?

[Insert, e.g., “Strategic thinking, collaboration, and increased influence in product direction.”]

**Guide me through writing the performance review:**

**2. Identify core themes**

Help me zoom out and spot the main threads of my work.

- What patterns show up in my projects, feedback, or ways of working?
- What 2–3 themes reflect my growth, leadership, or impact?

**3. Pull specific examples**

Guide me in choosing representative, outcome-driven examples.

- What work am I most proud of, and why?
- Which examples best show my influence on decisions, direction, or outcomes?

**4. Highlight strategic value**

Help me move beyond tasks to show critical thinking and leadership.

- How did I connect research to business, roadmap, or product decisions?
- What influence did I have beyond my own scope (team dynamics, alignment, risk reduction)?

**5. Communicate collaboration and visibility**

Guide me in showing how I worked with others and amplified impact.

- How did I support, guide, or enable cross-functional teams?
- Who benefited from my work, and how do I make that clear?

**6. Reflect on growth and development**

Help me articulate where I’ve grown.

- What new skills, muscles, or types of work did I take on this cycle?
- Where have I stepped up, simplified something, or driven change?

**7. Reflection and refinement**

Help me step back and polish the overall message.

- Does this reflect my impact and not just my activity?
- Is it readable, specific, and aligned with what leadership values?
- Would someone unfamiliar with my day-to-day understand my value?

Please guide me step-by-step to write a strong, strategic performance review that captures my impact, shows growth, and helps move me forward in my career.
