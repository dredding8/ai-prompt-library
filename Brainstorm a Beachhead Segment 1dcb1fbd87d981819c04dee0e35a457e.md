# Brainstorm a Beachhead Segment

Prompt: Act as a go-to-market strategist for a <product>.

Based on the attached information about my product, help me identify my first beachhead segment that matches the following criteria:
• Has a burning pain point,
• Displays decent willingness to pay,
• You can win 60-70% of the selected market in 3-18 months if your GTM journey,
• Will refer and recommend the product to others (adjacent segments).

Start small. Do not be afraid to go super-specific here.
