# Combine qual and quant with purpose

Category: Methods
Information needed?: Some information needed

**Context:**

Mixed methods research can be incredibly powerful—but only when each method has a clear role. This prompt helps you design a balanced, complementary mixed methods study that avoids redundancy, surfaces richer insights, and supports stronger decisions.

**Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help designing a mixed methods research study.

I need help designing a mixed methods research study where qualitative and quantitative approaches each play a clear, complementary role. Act as a thought partner to guide me step-by-step in defining goals, selecting the right mix of methods, and sequencing them with purpose. Assume I’m starting from scratch. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**1. Project context:**

- **What is the research about?**

[Insert details, e.g., “Understanding user trust in our new AI-generated content feature.”]

- **What decision(s) or outcome(s) will this research inform?**

[Insert details, e.g., “How to design more transparent UX patterns and which trust indicators to prioritize.”]

- **What constraints should I keep in mind?**

[Insert details, e.g., “Limited quant resources this quarter, fast turnaround needed.”]

**Guide me through designing the mixed methods study:**

**2. Define the research goals and questions:**

Help me clarify what I need to learn and why.

- What are the main learning goals of this study?
- Which of these goals are better suited to qualitative vs. quantitative methods?

**3. Select the appropriate methods:**

Guide me in choosing the right mix of approaches.

- What qual and quant methods are best suited to these goals (e.g., usability testing + survey, diary study + analytics)?
- How can I avoid overlap and make sure each method contributes something unique?

**4. Assign roles to each method:**

Help me define what each method is responsible for uncovering.

- What will qualitative research help me understand that quant can’t?
- What can quant help validate, scale, or challenge from the qual data?

**5. Determine the sequence:**

Guide me in structuring when and how each method will be used.

- Should qual come first to explore, or quant to identify patterns?
- How can I use results from one method to inform the other?

**6. Plan for synthesis:**

Help me think through how I’ll bring the data together into a single, coherent story.

- What strategies or frameworks can I use to merge findings from different methods?
- How can I avoid biasing one method over the other in synthesis?

**7. Reflection and refinement:**

Help me assess whether the study is balanced and well-structured:

- Are the methods clearly tied to specific goals?
- Do they complement rather than duplicate each other?
- Have I considered sequencing, logistics, and analysis?

Please guide me step-by-step to design a mixed methods study that uses qual and quant in clearly defined, purposeful ways that strengthen the overall research outcomes.

**Follow-up prompts:**

- Help me visualize the timeline and sequencing of each method in the study
- Suggest ways to present the value of mixed methods to stakeholders
- Draft a short justification for the use of mixed methods in this project plan
- Recommend tools or platforms for capturing and managing mixed data
- Help me identify risks or limitations in the proposed mixed methods approach
