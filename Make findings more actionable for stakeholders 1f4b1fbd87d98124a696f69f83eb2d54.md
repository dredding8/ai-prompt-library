Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help making your findings more actionable for stakeholders.

“I need help making my research findings more actionable for stakeholders. Act as a thought partner to guide me step-by-step in organizing findings, connecting them to stakeholder goals, and framing them as clear, actionable insights. Assume I’m starting with raw findings and need to make them more practical and relevant. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**Project context:**

- What product, feature, or experience does the research focus on?

[Insert details, e.g., “A feature that enables users to save frequently used searches.”]

- Who are the stakeholders, and what are their roles?

[Insert details, e.g., “Product managers and designers responsible for feature development.”]

- What decisions or actions should the findings support?

[Insert goals, e.g., “Prioritizing design changes to improve the feature’s usability.”]

- **What are the stakeholders’ goals or priorities?**

[Insert details, e.g., “To improve user adoption and retention for the feature by making it more intuitive and efficient.”]

**Clarify the goals of the findings:**

Help me identify what stakeholders need from the findings.

- What decisions or actions should the findings inform?
- How can I ensure the findings address the most critical stakeholder priorities?

**Organize and synthesize findings:**

Guide me in structuring findings to make them easier for stakeholders to understand and act on.

- How should I group related findings into themes or categories?
- What strategies can I use to highlight the most significant or impactful findings?

**Connect findings to stakeholder goals:**

Help me link the findings directly to stakeholder needs or goals.

- What questions should I ask to align the findings with specific business or product objectives?
- How can I demonstrate the relevance of each finding to the decisions stakeholders need to make?

**Frame findings as actionable insights:**

Guide me in transforming findings into clear, actionable insights.

- How can I phrase insights to make them specific and solution-oriented?
- What structure should I use to present each insight (e.g., “Finding → Implication → Recommendation”)?

**Create compelling visuals or summaries:**

Help me design a deliverable that effectively communicates the findings to stakeholders.

- What types of visuals (e.g., charts, graphs, journey maps) could help clarify the insights?
- How can I summarize the findings concisely without losing depth?

## Reflection questions:

- Are the recommendations specific, feasible, and aligned with stakeholder priorities?
- Have I communicated the “why” behind each recommendation to show its importance?
- Am I missing any recommendations that stakeholders might expect or need?
- How can I tailor the recommendations to fit the team’s resources, timeline, or constraints?
- What’s the one key takeaway I want stakeholders to remember from these findings?

Please guide me step-by-step in organizing and framing the findings to ensure they are actionable, aligned with stakeholder goals, and presented in a clear and compelling way.”

## **Follow-Up Prompts:**

- “Draft a one-pager summarizing the findings and recommendations for stakeholder review.”
- “Suggest ways to prioritize recommendations by impact and feasibility.”
- “Write a short email or presentation script to explain the recommendations to stakeholders.”
- “Propose metrics for tracking the success of implementing the recommendations.”
- “Identify any potential pushback from stakeholders and suggest strategies for addressing it.”
