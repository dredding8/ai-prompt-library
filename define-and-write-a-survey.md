Category: Methods, Planning
Information needed?: Some information needed

## **Context:**

A well-designed survey captures meaningful data and aligns with research objectives. This prompt helps you define your goals, structure your survey, and write clear, unbiased questions to collect actionable insights.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM and use it to define and create a survey for your user research project.

“I need help designing a survey for user research. Guide me through defining my goals, structuring the survey, and writing effective questions that collect clear and actionable insights.

**Define the research purpose:**

- What is the goal of this survey?
    - Example: “To understand how users engage with a fitness app and identify pain points.”
- What decisions or actions will the survey inform?
    - Example: “Prioritize features for the app’s next update.”

**Identify the audience and sample:**

- Who are the target respondents for this survey?
    - Example: “Fitness app users aged 18-45.”
- What sample size is needed for meaningful results?
    - Example: “400 respondents for statistical confidence with a ±5% margin of error.”

**Draft survey structure:**

What sections should the survey include? Example:

1. Introduction and consent
2. Demographics (if needed)
3. Engagement with current features
4. Pain points and challenges

**Write survey questions:**

1. **Introduction and Consent:**

“This survey will take about [X] minutes and is intended to help us improve [product/service]. Your responses are anonymous. Do you consent to participate?”

1. **Demographics (optional):**
- “What is your age group?”
    - Answer options: Under 18, 18-25, 26-35, 36-45, 46+
- “Which of the following best describes your fitness routine?”
    - Answer options: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
1. **Engagement with Features:**
- “How often do you use the app to track your workouts?”
    - Answer scale: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Rarely, Never
- “Which app features do you use most often?”
    - Answer options: Workout tracking, Goal setting, Community forums, Other (please specify)
1. **Pain Points and Challenges:**
    1. “What is the biggest challenge you face when using the app?” (Open-ended)
    2. “How satisfied or dissatisfied are you with the app’s ease of navigation?”
        1. Answer scale: Very Satisfied, Somewhat Satisfied, Neutral, Somewhat Dissatisfied, Very Dissatisfied

## **Reflection questions:**

- Are the questions clear, concise, and free of bias?
- Do the response options cover all likely answers, including “Other” where applicable?
- Does the survey flow logically from general to specific topics?
- Are there any unnecessary questions that can be removed to keep the survey short?

Please expand this into a complete, ready-to-distribute survey that aligns with my research objectives.”

## **Follow-Up Prompts:**

- “Suggest ways to test this survey with a small group before full distribution.”
- “Write a summary email or introduction for participants when sending out the survey.”
- “Propose metrics for analyzing the survey data and identifying key trends.”
- “Create a visual dashboard outline to present the survey results to stakeholders.”
- “Draft questions to evaluate the effectiveness of the survey after responses are collected.”
