Information needed?: Information needed

## **Context:**

You’re about to start a research project and want a clear, actionable plan that focuses on the most impactful goals. This prompt helps you outline your plan step-by-step while reflecting on your priorities, ensuring no important details are missed. Use the thought-partner questions to challenge your thinking as you go.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste the following into your LLM. Work through each step, and where needed, include the thought-partner reflections to ensure your plan is sharp, actionable, and focused.

**“I’m creating a research plan for [describe your project in 1-2 sentences]. Here are the steps to complete it:**

## **Step 1: Define the purpose of the research.**

1. What is the goal of this project? (e.g., understand X behavior, identify opportunities for Y improvement)
2. Who will use this research, and what decision or action will it inform?

**Reflection:**

- What will success look like for this project?
- If I could only answer one question, what would it be?

## **Step 2: Write the 3-5 key research questions.**

1. Question 1: [Insert]
2. Question 2: [Insert]
3. Question 3: [Insert]

**Reflection:**

- Are these questions specific enough to deliver actionable insights?
- Do they directly align with the research purpose?
- What questions am I missing that might be good for my stakeholders?

## **Step 3: Prioritize the questions by impact and feasibility.**

1. High Impact / Easy Feasibility → [Insert question]
2. High Impact / Moderate Feasibility → [Insert question]
3. Low Impact / Hard Feasibility → [Consider deprioritizing this one.]

**Reflection:**

- Am I focusing on the questions that matter most for my stakeholders?
- Are there “nice-to-have” questions that I can deprioritize to save time?

## **Step 4: Select methods to answer each question.**

1. Question 1: [Insert method, e.g., interviews, surveys, usability testing]
2. Question 2: [Insert method]
3. Question 3: [Insert method]

**Reflection:**

- Will these methods give me the depth or breadth of insights I need?
- Are these methods realistic given my time, budget, and resources?
- What other methods could give us this information?

## **Step 5: Draft the timeline for the research.**

1. Setup: [Insert time estimate]
2. Recruitment: [Insert time estimate]
3. Fieldwork: [Insert time estimate]
4. Analysis: [Insert time estimate]
5. Reporting: [Insert time estimate]

**Reflection:**

- Does this timeline align with stakeholder expectations?
- If I had to cut one phase or step to save time, what would it be?

## **Step 6: Sanity-check the plan.**

- Does this plan directly answer the research goals? [Yes/No]
- What is one potential blocker I need to plan for now?

“Please expand this into a polished, detailed research plan. Ensure each phase and reflection is addressed clearly and concisely, and confirm it aligns with my goals and resources.”

1. **Risk and assumption mapping**:
    1. “What are the biggest assumptions I’m making with this plan?”
    2. “What risks could impact this research (e.g., recruitment delays, participant quality)?”
        1. “What are the best ways to mitigate these risks?”
