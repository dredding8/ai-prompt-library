Category: Recruitment
Information needed?: Some information needed

## **Context:**

Recruiting participants from hard-to-reach or niche audiences can be challenging, but thoughtful planning ensures success. This prompt helps you identify the right strategies, refine your approach, and address potential blockers so you can recruit effectively and efficiently.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM. Follow the steps and use the reflection questions to plan a strong recruitment strategy that reaches your target audience.

“I’m planning to recruit participants for a research project targeting [insert hard-to-reach audience, e.g., ‘busy healthcare professionals,’ ‘Gen Z freelancers,’ or ‘people with accessibility needs’]. Help me build a detailed, actionable recruitment plan:

## **Clarify the participant profile**:

- Who exactly am I trying to reach?
- Demographics: [Age, region, income level, role, etc.]
- Behaviors: [e.g., “Uses X tool daily,” “Participates in Y activity weekly.”]
- Other defining criteria: [Insert, e.g., “must have experienced Z.”]

## **Identify recruitment challenges**:

- Why are these participants hard to reach?
    - Example: “They’re too busy,” “They’re hesitant to participate,” “They’re underrepresented in typical recruitment channels.”

## **List potential recruitment strategies**:

- Brainstorm ways to reach this audience effectively. Examples:
    - Partner with relevant organizations or communities.
    - Use niche platforms (e.g., LinkedIn groups, Reddit, Slack communities).
    - Offer targeted incentives that resonate with this audience.
    - Use snowball sampling: Ask participants to refer others.

## **Design your outreach materials**:

Draft a recruitment email, message, or post tailored to this audience. Include:

- A clear description of the research purpose.
- Why their input matters.
- What’s in it for them (e.g., incentives, impact).

Example:

“We’re conducting research to [insert purpose]. Your experience with [insert topic] is invaluable. Participating takes just [time], and you’ll receive [reward]. Your input will help improve [product/experience].”

## **Plan incentives that motivate**:

- What incentives will appeal to this audience?
    - Example: Gift cards, donations to causes they care about, professional recognition, or exclusive early access to results.

## **Reflection questions**:

- What assumptions am I making about how this audience can be reached? How might I test or challenge those assumptions?
- Are there gatekeepers (e.g., organizations, influencers) I need to engage to access this audience?
- Have I considered potential barriers (e.g., trust, cultural sensitivity, time availability)?
- Is the incentive meaningful enough to motivate participation without creating bias?

## **Output a recruitment timeline**:

Write a step-by-step timeline with tasks, channels, and key milestones for the recruitment process:

- Week 1: Draft materials and identify channels.
- Week 2: Begin outreach.
- Week 3: Follow up and monitor responses.

Please expand this into a polished, step-by-step recruitment plan with tailored outreach strategies, a messaging draft, and a realistic timeline.”

## **Follow-up prompts:**

1. “Draft 2-3 versions of outreach messages tailored for different channels or gatekeepers (e.g., email, social media, or partnerships).”
2. “Identify and prioritize the recruitment channels with the highest likelihood of success. Suggest a backup strategy for low response rates.”
3. “Write a risk mitigation plan to address challenges like low sign-ups, lack of referrals, or unresponsive gatekeepers.”
4. “Suggest ways to build trust with this audience to increase their willingness to participate.”
5. “Create a recruitment status check template to help me monitor outreach progress and response rates weekly.”
6. “Suggest channels that I might not of thought of where I can get access to these participants.”
