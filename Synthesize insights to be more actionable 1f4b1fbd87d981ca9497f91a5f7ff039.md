## **Context:**

Synthesizing research insights into actionable takeaways ensures they can drive meaningful decisions and changes. This prompt helps you distill your findings into clear themes, align them with stakeholder goals, and create practical recommendations.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM and use it to transform insights into actionable outputs.

“I need help synthesizing my research insights to make them more actionable. Guide me step-by-step to distill key findings, align them with stakeholder goals, and generate practical recommendations.

**Review the insights:**

Provide a list of raw insights from your research. Example:

1. “Participants struggled to locate the search bar.”
2. “Users indicated the layout felt cluttered and overwhelming.”
3. “Confusion over multiple account sign-in options caused drop-offs.”

Identify key themes:

Group related insights into broader themes that reflect patterns across the data. Example:

- Theme 1: “Navigation challenges.”
    - Insight: “Participants struggled to locate the search bar.”
- Theme 2: “Overloaded design.”
    - Insight: “Users indicated the layout felt cluttered and overwhelming.”

**Link themes to stakeholder goals:**

- What are the primary goals or priorities of your stakeholders?
    - Example: “Streamline the user experience to increase engagement and reduce drop-offs.”
- Align each theme with a stakeholder goal or decision-making need. Example:
    - Theme: “Navigation challenges.”
    - Stakeholder Goal: “Make key features easier to find to improve task completion rates.”

**Draft actionable recommendations:**

For each theme, write a clear, specific, and feasible recommendation. Example:

- Theme: “Navigation challenges.”
- Recommendation: “Move the search bar to a prominent position, such as the top center of the page.”
- Theme: “Overloaded design.”
- Recommendation: “Simplify the layout by reducing the number of visible elements on the homepage.”

Please expand this into a structured summary of themes, insights, and actionable recommendations that align with stakeholder goals.”

## Reflection questions:

- Are these recommendations specific and feasible given the team’s resources?
- Do they directly address stakeholder goals and objectives?
- Am I accounting for potential trade-offs or secondary effects of these recommendations?
- Have I summarized the findings in a way that’s easy for stakeholders to understand and act on?

## **Follow-Up Prompts:**

- “Suggest a visual format (e.g., table, diagram) to present the themes, insights, and recommendations clearly.”
- “Draft a summary email or presentation script to share these actionable takeaways with stakeholders.”
- “Identify any gaps in the recommendations and propose ways to address them.”
- “Write a prioritization framework for the recommendations based on impact and feasibility.”
- “Propose metrics or KPIs to measure the success of implementing these recommendations.”
