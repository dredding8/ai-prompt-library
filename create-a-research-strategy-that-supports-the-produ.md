# Create a research strategy that supports the product from discovery to launch

Category: Planning
Information needed?: Some information needed

**Context:**

Designing research that supports a product across its full lifecycle—from early discovery through validation and launch—requires intention, prioritization, and collaboration. This prompt helps you think across phases, define key learning goals, and build a cohesive, phased strategy that aligns with the evolving needs of the product team.

**Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help planning a multi-phase research strategy across a product lifecycle.

“I need help creating a multi-phase research strategy that aligns with the product’s lifecycle from discovery through launch. Act as a thought partner to guide me step-by-step in planning each phase of research, identifying key questions, and recommending appropriate methods. Assume I’m starting from scratch. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**1. Project context:**

- **What is the product or feature?**

[Insert details, e.g., “A new dashboard for B2B customers to monitor usage and performance.”]

- **What stage is the product currently in?**

[Insert details, e.g., “Early concepting—no designs exist yet.”]

- **What are the cross-functional team’s goals or priorities over the next few months?**

[Insert details, e.g., “Define the MVP, validate usefulness, and prepare for alpha launch.”]

**Guide me through creating the strategy:**

**2. Define the product lifecycle stages:**

Help me break down the phases of this product’s lifecycle that research should support.

- What are the typical phases I should plan for (e.g., discovery, concept validation, prototyping, beta testing, post-launch)?
- How can I define learning goals at each phase that are tied to key decisions?

**3. Identify research goals per phase:**

Guide me in determining the learning objectives for each phase.

- What does the team need to know at each stage to move forward with confidence?
- What questions should I be asking during early exploration vs. later validation?

**4. Recommend methods for each phase:**

Help me map the best research methods to each set of goals.

- What methods make sense during early discovery?
- What methods are best for validating assumptions, testing usability, or understanding adoption?
- How can I balance qual and quant as the product matures?

**5. Plan for resources and timing:**

Help me estimate what resources and time I’ll need across phases.

- What’s a realistic timeline for research during a fast-moving product cycle?
- How can I stagger methods to avoid bottlenecks while still learning what we need?

**6. Align with stakeholders and roadmap:**

Guide me in embedding this research strategy into the product development process.

- How can I present this plan to PMs, design leads, and execs to show how research supports their goals?
- How do I stay flexible and adjust as the roadmap shifts?

**7. Reflection and refinement:**

Help me reflect on whether the strategy is clear, complete, and realistic:

- Have I defined clear learning goals and decision points for each phase?
- Are the methods appropriate for what we need to learn and when?
- Have I built in time to analyze and socialize the findings across teams?

Please guide me step-by-step to create a clear, multi-phase research strategy that supports the product across its lifecycle—from discovery to launch.”

**Follow-up prompts:**

- Help me turn this strategy into a visual research roadmap.
- Draft a stakeholder summary of how research will support each product phase.
- Suggest ways to stay adaptable as timelines or priorities shift.
- Create a checklist to revisit and update this strategy each quarter.
- Help me identify research gaps or duplication across product phases.
