# Turn past research into reusable insights

Category: Deliverables, Reporting, Synthesis
Information needed?: Information needed

**Context:**

You’ve done valuable research—but the findings often stay buried in docs, decks, or shared folders. This prompt helps you identify recurring patterns across past projects and organize them into a searchable, shareable library of user insights that your team can actually use.

**Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help turning past research into a pattern library.

I need help identifying recurring insights across past research and turning them into a usable pattern library. Act as a thought partner to guide me step-by-step in reviewing past work, clustering insights, and organizing them in a format that’s useful across projects and teams. Assume I’m starting from scratch. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**1. Project context:**

- **What types of research projects have you run in the past 6–12 months?**

[Insert details, e.g., “Usability testing, journey mapping, feature evaluations.”]

- **What types of patterns or themes do you think might emerge?**

[Insert ideas, e.g., “Trust, navigation issues, unmet expectations.”]

- **Who will use this pattern library and for what purpose?**

[Insert details, e.g., “Designers and PMs referencing past insights before starting new features.”]

**Guide me through building the pattern library:**

**2. Gather and review past research:**

Help me identify what to include.

- Which past studies are worth reviewing for recurring insights?
- What types of outputs (e.g., reports, notes, transcripts) should I revisit?
- How can I prioritize which ones to start with?

**3. Extract and cluster key insights:**

Guide me in pulling out relevant data and finding connections.

- What criteria should I use to decide what counts as a “pattern”?
- How can I group similar insights across studies without overgeneralizing?

**4. Define clear patterns or themes:**

Help me write themes that are specific, reusable, and clear.

- What makes a theme actionable and not just a broad label?
- How can I connect each pattern to supporting evidence (e.g., quotes, metrics)?

**5. Organize the library for usability:**

Guide me in creating a structure that’s easy to navigate and update.

- What metadata or tags should I use (e.g., audience, product area, behavior type)?
- Should I group patterns by journey stage, problem type, or another model?

**6. Make the library usable across teams:**

Help me think about how others will interact with the library.

- What format should I use (e.g., Notion, Airtable, custom doc)?
- How can I make it searchable, skimmable, and not overwhelming?

**7. Reflection and refinement:**

Help me assess whether the pattern library is ready to share and evolve:

- Are the insights grouped in a way that makes sense for my team’s workflows?
- Is the structure flexible enough to grow as new research is added?
- What process can I set up to maintain and update the library over time?

Please guide me step-by-step to build a pattern library that captures my team’s past insights and makes them accessible and actionable for future work.

**Follow-up prompts:**

- Help me draft a short internal guide for how to use the pattern library
- Suggest tools or templates for setting up the library (Notion, Airtable, etc.)
- Recommend ways to keep the library updated as new research is completed
- Propose strategies for encouraging cross-functional teams to actually use it
- Create a checklist for reviewing past projects and extracting reusable insights
