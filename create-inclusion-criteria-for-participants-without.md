# Create inclusion criteria for participants without over-filtering

Category: Recruitment
Information needed?: Information needed

## **Context:**

Creating inclusion criteria that are **clear but not overly restrictive** ensures you recruit high-quality participants without accidentally excluding valuable perspectives. This prompt helps you define criteria thoughtfully, identify biases, and strike the right balance between precision and inclusion.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM. Follow the steps and use the reflection prompts to ensure your inclusion criteria are focused, balanced, and actionable.

“I need to create inclusion criteria for participants in a research study focused on [describe the project, e.g., ‘understanding how people use our budgeting app’]. Help me build clear and inclusive criteria without over-filtering:

## **Clarify the target audience**:

- What are the key characteristics I’m looking for?
    - **Behaviors**: [What they do, e.g., ‘Uses budgeting apps weekly.’]
    - **Demographics**: [If relevant, e.g., ‘Adults aged 25-40.’]
    - **Experiences**: [Relevant past experiences, e.g., ‘People who have switched budgeting tools in the last 6 months.’]

## **Identify must-have vs. nice-to-have criteria**:

- **Must-have criteria**: What’s absolutely essential for participants to provide meaningful insights?
    - Must-have: Uses a budgeting app weekly.
    - **Nice-to-have criteria**: What would be helpful but not critical?
        - Nice-to-have: Recently purchased a subscription-based budgeting tool.

## **Challenge assumptions about filtering**:

- Am I unintentionally excluding valuable participants?
    - Example reflection: If I exclude people who only use free apps, will I miss important perspectives?
    - Are my criteria too narrow for a reasonable sample size?

## **Refine and simplify the criteria**:

- Combine or adjust criteria to avoid over-filtering:
    - Example: Instead of “uses budgeting apps daily,” broaden to “uses budgeting apps at least once a week.”

**Draft the inclusion criteria**:

- Write 3-5 clear criteria participants must meet:
    - [Insert key criterion]
    - [Insert key criterion]
    - [Insert key criterion]

## **Reflection questions:**

- What’s the risk of being too strict with my criteria?
- Are there voices or experiences I’m unintentionally excluding?
- Could relaxing any of these criteria still allow me to achieve my research goals?
- Have I accounted for diversity (e.g., in demographics, behaviors, or experiences)?

## **Output checklist**:

Create a clean checklist that summarizes the final inclusion criteria for recruitment partners or stakeholders:

Participants **must**:

- Meet [insert must-have criterion].
- Meet [insert must-have criterion].
- Participants **may optionally**:
    - [Insert nice-to-have characteristic].

Please expand this into a clear, inclusive list of participant criteria and provide a checklist that’s easy to share for recruitment.”

## **Follow-up prompts:**

1. “Suggest 2-3 alternative ways to broaden my criteria without compromising research quality.”
2. “Identify potential biases in my criteria and recommend changes to improve inclusion.”
3. “If I get too few participants using these criteria, what adjustments can I make to still gather meaningful insights?”
4. “Draft a brief explanation I can share with stakeholders on how these criteria balance inclusion and research needs.”
5. “Suggest how I can validate whether these criteria are effective for recruiting the right participants (e.g., test recruitment messages or pilot the screener).”
