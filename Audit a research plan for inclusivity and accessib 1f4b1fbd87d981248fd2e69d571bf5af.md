# Audit a research plan for inclusivity and accessibility

Category: Planning
Information needed?: Information needed

**Context:**

It’s easy to unintentionally exclude people when planning research. This prompt helps you audit your research plan—recruitment, materials, methods, and logistics—to ensure it’s inclusive, respectful, and accessible to a wide range of participants.

Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help reviewing a research plan for inclusivity and accessibility.

I need help auditing a research plan to make sure it’s inclusive and accessible. Act as a thought partner to help me review everything from recruitment and screening to logistics and session design—so I’m not unintentionally excluding people or creating barriers. Assume I already have a rough research plan. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**1. Project context:**

- **What is the research about, and who is it intended to reach?**

[Insert, e.g., “Testing a beta version of a scheduling tool for freelancers.”]

- **What methods are you using?**

[Insert, e.g., “Remote 1:1 usability testing and a follow-up survey.”]

- **What concerns or priorities do you already have about inclusion?**

[Insert, e.g., “I want to make sure we’re not only hearing from the most tech-savvy or English-dominant users.”]

**Guide me through auditing the research plan:**

**2. Review recruitment and screeners:**

Help me assess who might be excluded from participating.

- Are any criteria (explicit or implicit) limiting diversity in language, ability, geography, or tech access?
- Am I unintentionally prioritizing convenience over representation?

**3. Evaluate methods and formats:**

Guide me in choosing inclusive approaches.

- Do the research methods allow for different communication styles, tech access, or cognitive needs?
- Should I offer alternatives to video calls, like phone or asynchronous options?

**4. Review communication and language:**

Help me ensure my outreach and materials are accessible.

- Is the language in my emails, screeners, and guides clear, simple, and free of jargon?
- Have I translated or localized materials where appropriate?

**5. Check accessibility of tools and platforms:**

Guide me in evaluating the tech setup.

- Are the platforms I’m using screen-reader compatible, mobile-friendly, or available in multiple languages?
- Are there backup options for participants who have unreliable internet or devices?

**6. Plan for equitable compensation and logistics:**

Help me reduce barriers to participation.

- Am I compensating fairly and offering flexible ways to receive incentives?
- Have I accounted for time zones, caregiving responsibilities, or work schedules?

**7. Reflection and refinement:**

Help me assess the inclusivity of this plan as a whole:

- Who might I still be unintentionally leaving out?
- Have I created a setup where a wide range of people can participate comfortably and equitably?
- What steps can I take now—or build into future cycles—to improve?

Please guide me step-by-step to review and improve my research plan so that it’s more inclusive, accessible, and respectful of diverse participants.

**Follow-up prompts:**

- Suggest inclusive screener question alternatives for a specific audience
- Help me write outreach emails in plain, friendly language
- Recommend platforms or tools that are more accessible for remote research
- Draft a checklist I can use to run future inclusion audits on my research plans
- Propose ways to share back what I learned with participants in a respectful, equitable way
