# Create WWAs

Prompt: Act as an experienced product manager for a <product>.

Create a set of product backlog items for <a new feature> based on the attached design and <key assumptions>. 

When creating product backlog items:
• Aim to create independent, negotiable, valuable, small, and testable items that can be estimated.
• Use a language a primary school graduate can understand.

[Important] The expected format:

1. Why: 1-2 sentences that tie the work to the strategic context and team objectives.

2. What: Short description and a link to designs. Typically 1-2 paragraphs. It's just a reminder of what was discussed, not a detailed specification.

3. Acceptance Criteria: A few high-level bullet points. Those are not detailed test scenarios. And it's not a contract.
