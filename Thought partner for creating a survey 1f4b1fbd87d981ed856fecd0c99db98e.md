“I need help creating a survey from scratch. Act as a thought partner and guide me step-by-step through defining my goals, brainstorming questions, and structuring the survey. Assume I’m starting with no predefined questions or structure. Here’s the context for the survey I’m building:

**Project context:**

- What is the purpose of the survey?

[Insert purpose, e.g., “To understand customer satisfaction with our app.”]

- Who are the target respondents?

[Insert target audience, e.g., “Current app users who have completed at least one purchase.”]

- What decisions or actions will this survey inform?

[Insert outcomes, e.g., “Identify areas for improving the app’s checkout process.”]

**Define the survey goals:**

Help me clarify what I need to learn from this survey.

- What specific questions am I trying to answer with the survey results?
- How can I ensure the goals are clear and actionable?

**Brainstorm survey questions:**

Guide me in creating questions that align with the goals.

- What types of questions should I ask to capture the most relevant data?
- How can I ensure the questions are clear, unbiased, and easy to understand?
- What mix of question types should I include (e.g., multiple-choice, Likert scales, open-ended)?

**Choose response formats:**

Help me decide the best response options for my questions.

- How can I determine when to use scales, rankings, or binary choices?
- How should I design open-ended questions to encourage thoughtful responses?

**Structure the survey:**

Guide me in organizing the questions to create a logical flow.

- How should I start the survey to engage respondents?
- What strategies can I use to reduce fatigue or drop-offs as respondents progress?
- How can I ensure each section aligns with my goals and captures the data I need?

**Test and refine:**

Help me review and refine the survey before distribution.

- How can I identify and fix unclear or biased questions?
- What steps can I take to test the survey with a small group and gather feedback?
- How can I ensure the survey length is appropriate for the audience?

## **Reflection questions:**

Help me reflect on whether the survey is ready for launch:

- Does the survey align with the goals I’ve outlined?
- Will the questions capture actionable insights for decision-making?
- Are there any gaps or areas I should address before distributing the survey?

Please guide me step-by-step to build this survey, providing suggestions and examples where helpful, based on the context I’ve provided.”

**Follow-up prompts:**

- “Suggest tools or platforms to create and distribute the survey.”
- “Draft an email or message to invite participants to complete the survey.”
- “Propose strategies to analyze the survey results effectively once collected.”
- “Create a checklist for reviewing and refining the survey before launch.”
- “Help me prioritize the most critical questions if the survey needs to be shortened.”
