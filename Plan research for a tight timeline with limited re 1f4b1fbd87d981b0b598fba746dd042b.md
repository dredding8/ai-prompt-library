# Plan research for a tight timeline with limited resources

Category: Planning
Information needed?: Some information needed

## **Context:**

When time and resources are limited, it’s essential to streamline your research plan. This prompt helps you prioritize, simplify, and deliver actionable results under constraints.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this structure into your LLM and use it to plan efficiently:

“I need to plan a research project on [insert topic, e.g., ‘user needs for a new feature’], but I have limited time ([insert duration, e.g., ‘2 weeks’]) and resources ([insert, e.g., ‘small team, low budget’]). Help me create a streamlined plan:

## **Clarify research goals**:

- What is the single most important thing I need to learn?

## **Choose a lightweight research method**:

- Based on the goal, recommend a fast, efficient research method.
    - Example: Short interviews, lightweight surveys, or quick usability tests.

## **Streamline the process**:

- What steps can I cut or simplify while maintaining quality?

## **Reflection questions**:

- What’s the minimum viable output I need to deliver for stakeholders?
- How can I ensure actionable findings despite constraints?
- What’s the minimum amount of data I need to deliver actionable insights? What’s optional?
- How can I simplify recruitment or testing without sacrificing participant quality?
- What risks could arise from running this research on a tight timeline, and how can I address them?
- If I had one extra day or resource, where would I invest it for the biggest impact?

## **Summarize the plan**:

- ‘This research will focus on [insert goals] using [insert method] within [insert timeline].’

Please output a concise research plan that balances speed, impact, and quality.”

## **Follow-up prompts:**

1. “What’s one risk of running research this quickly, and how can I mitigate it?”
2. “Draft a stakeholder update explaining the streamlined plan and its limitations.”
3. “Draft a ‘minimum viable research plan’ that outlines the streamlined methods, timelines, and outputs.”
4. “Create a risk mitigation plan to address potential challenges, like low recruitment or incomplete data.”
5. “Summarize the constraints (time, team, resources) into a brief stakeholder update to manage expectations.”
6. “Suggest lightweight ways to validate findings quickly (e.g., small follow-up interviews or surveys).”
