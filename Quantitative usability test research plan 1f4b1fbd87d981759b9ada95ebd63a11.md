# Quantitative usability test research plan

Category: Planning
Information needed?: Information needed

## **Context:**

Quantitative usability tests are perfect for identifying measurable outcomes like task success rates, completion times, and error frequencies. Use this prompt to design a structured, metrics-driven usability test that collects actionable data.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM, and let it guide you step-by-step to design a quantitative test.

“I need help planning a quantitative usability test to evaluate [describe the product/feature]. Help me create a structured, metrics-driven plan with the following details:

## **Define my goals**:

- What do I need to measure?
    - Example: Task completion rates, time on task, or error rates.

## **Identify participants**:

- Who are the users I’ll test?
    - Example: 25 participants who [criteria, e.g., use the app weekly].

## **Design participant tasks**:

- Task 1: [Insert task, e.g., ‘Add an item to the cart and proceed to checkout.’]
- Task 2: [Insert next task].

## **Define success metrics for each task**:

Task 1:

- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of participants who complete the task successfully.
- **Time on Task**: Average time taken to complete the task.
- **Error Rate**: Frequency of mistakes during task completion.

Task 2:

- Define similar metrics here.

## **Plan the test setup**:

- Will this test be moderated or unmoderated? [Choose one.]
- What tools will I use for the test? [Examples: Maze, Lookback, UserTesting.]

## **Reflection questions:**

- Do my tasks align with real-world user goals?
- Are the success metrics clearly defined and measurable?
- Is my sample size large enough to identify meaningful patterns?
- How do I explain the sample size to my stakeholders?

**Next steps**:

Create a test structure with participant tasks, success metrics, and tools for execution. Please expand this into a detailed quantitative usability test plan with tasks, metrics, and setup considerations.”

## **Follow-up prompts:**

1. “What insights from the metrics (e.g., task success rates, error rates) are most critical for stakeholders? Summarize 3-5 key findings that highlight clear issues or successes.”
2. “How can I align the quantitative results with stakeholder goals? Create a 1-page summary that connects the findings to business priorities, such as revenue impact or user retention.”
3. “What in this plan is most likely to get stakeholder pushback or questions? Write clear justifications for the findings, including how the data was collected and any limitations to address concerns.”
