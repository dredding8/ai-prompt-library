# Get started with jobs-to-be-done (JTBD) in user research

Category: Methods
Information needed?: Some information needed

## **Context:**

The jobs-to-be-done (JTBD) framework can help researchers uncover why users choose products or services and what they’re ultimately trying to achieve. Starting with JTBD can feel overwhelming without a clear path. This prompt acts as a thought partner, guiding researchers step-by-step to integrate JTBD into their work.

**Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help starting with JTBD for your user research project.

“I’m stuck on how to get started with jobs-to-be-done (JTBD) and need help understanding the process, identifying user ‘jobs,’ and integrating the framework into my research. Act as a thought partner and guide me step-by-step, providing tailored suggestions based on the context I’ve provided below. Assume I have no prior experience with JTBD.

**Project context:**

- What product, feature, or experience are you focusing on?

[Insert details, e.g., “A meal planning app for busy parents.”]

- What are your primary research goals?

[Insert goals, e.g., “To understand what drives users to choose our app and what they aim to accomplish with it.”]

- Who are your target users or customer segments?

[Insert user details, e.g., “Parents aged 30-45 who want quick meal solutions.”]

**Understand the JTBD framework:**

Help me understand the core principles of JTBD in user research.

- What questions should I ask to uncover what users are “hiring” this product to do?
- How can I identify the underlying motivations and circumstances driving user decisions?

**Define the job:**

Guide me in framing the primary “job” users are trying to get done.

- How can I uncover the functional, emotional, and social aspects of the job?
- What strategies can I use to gather clues from user behaviors, pain points, or workarounds?

**Plan JTBD-specific research questions:**

Help me brainstorm questions tailored to uncovering jobs-to-be-done.

- What types of questions can I ask users to understand their goals, challenges, and decision-making processes?
- How can I use storytelling techniques to encourage users to describe their “jobs” in context?

**Create a research plan:**

Guide me in designing a research plan to focus on JTBD.

- What methods (e.g., interviews, surveys, or observation) are best suited for uncovering JTBD insights?
- How can I ensure the plan aligns with my research goals and user segments?

**Analyze and frame the insights:**

Help me synthesize the research findings to articulate user jobs.

- What frameworks or templates can I use to clearly describe the jobs users are trying to accomplish?
- How can I connect the jobs to actionable recommendations for the product or business?

## **Reflection questions:**

Help me reflect on the JTBD process to ensure I’m capturing the right insights:

- Are the jobs I’ve identified truly reflective of user needs and goals?
- How can I refine or validate the jobs through additional research or stakeholder input?
- What steps can I take to ensure these insights drive meaningful product decisions?

Please act as a thought partner, prompting reflection and guiding me step-by-step to confidently integrate JTBD into my research project.”

**Follow-up prompts:**

- “Help me craft interview questions specifically for uncovering JTBD.”
- “Suggest tools or templates to document and visualize user jobs.”
- “Draft a stakeholder presentation to explain the JTBD insights and their implications.”
- “Propose ways to validate the identified jobs with additional research or testing.”
- “Help me link the JTBD insights to product roadmap decisions or business outcomes.”
