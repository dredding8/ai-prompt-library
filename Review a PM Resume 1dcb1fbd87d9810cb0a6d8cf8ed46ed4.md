Your task is to review MY RESUME and provide feedback to ensure it aligns with the guidelines from RESUME BEST PRACTICES and matches the requirements of the JOB OFFER.

1) RESUME BEST PRACTICES:

Your resume is your ticket to the interview. Its only goal is to quickly persuade the recruiter that you match all the criteria. Recruiters will spend just a few seconds looking at your resume before deciding what to do next, so they must be able to easily identify all phrases and keywords from the job offer. Ensure there are no distractions or irrelevant information.

1. Professional Summary

• If you decide to include it, make it concise, no more than 2-3 lines of text.
• Focus on what's truly unique about your experience in the context of that company, not on generic statements.

2. Personal Pronouns

• Important: Avoid words like "me" "I" "his" "her" etc. Not a single Personal Pronoun can be present in the Professional Summary.
• Important: Not a single Personal Pronoun can be present in the bullet points.
• Example: instead of "I'm an experienced product manager..." use "Experienced product manager..."
• Example: Instead of "I led the implementation," use "Led the implementation..."

3. Keep Resume Concise and to the Point

• A standard resume is 1-2 pages long (A4).
• Focus only on the most critical and relevant information.
• Use no more than 3–5 bullet points per job title.

4. Use the XYZ+S Formula

• Each bullet point should start with a strong action verb like "pioneered," "led," "achieved," or "reduced."
• Good Advice (XYZ Formula): Use numbers and facts: “Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z].” Example: “Reduced churn rate by 15% by conducting continuous product discovery and working closely with a cross-functional team.”
• Great Advice (XYZ+S): Be specific in your actions: “Reduced churn rate by 15% by conducting user interviews, identifying and prioritizing pain points, testing assumptions, and collaborating with a cross-functional team.”

5. Use a Professional Email Address

• 35% of recruiters see an unprofessional email address as a deal-breaker.
• A Gmail address with your first and last name is a safe solution but others can work too.

6. Tailor Your Resume to the Specific Job

Your resume is your ticket to the interview. Recruiters need to quickly identify all elements they are looking for:
• Ensure that the information is relevant and targeted to the particular job description.
• Analyze keywords and phrases from the job offer (e.g., "cross-functional teams," "Agile delivery," "complex workflows" - only those, that actually appear in the job offer).
• Include them, ideally all, in your bullet points.
• The most important are your last 1-2 jobs, so focus on them the most.

7. Product and Business Skills

• Do not include sections like "Skills," other than technical skills relevant for the job, such as "Jira," "Machine Learning," "N8N," "Miro," or "Figma."
• All product and business skills (such as Product Discovery, Managing Stakeholders, Agile) must be present in your bullet points, supported by specific achievements you can measure (XYZ+S).

8. Include All Necessary Elements in The Right Order

In this order:
• Contact Information: Location (country, city), phone number, and email.
• Employment History: Consistent date formatting starting with your most recent position.
• Education: Start with your most recent degree; you can skip the dates.
• Optional Certificates: Such as "Continuous Product Discovery Masterclass"; you can skip the dates. Do not suggest anything related to Scrum.
• Optional Technical Skills that are relevant for the job.

9. Advice for Graduates

• Highlight any relevant coursework or projects you completed.
• Include internships, part-time jobs, or volunteer work.
• These experiences can show practical experience and transferable skills.

10. Adjust the Language

• Adjust your resume to help recruiters better understand your experience.
• If your job title differs from industry standards but your responsibilities align, use the more accurate title (for example "Product Owner" > "Product Manager," if your company doesn't have Product Owners but this is what you actually did)
• You can explain discrepancies during the interview.
• Communicate your experience effectively, in language others understand.
