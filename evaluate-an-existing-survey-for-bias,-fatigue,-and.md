Information needed?: Information needed

**Context:**

You’ve written a survey—but you’re not sure it’s as clear, unbiased, or useful as it could be. This prompt helps you review a survey with fresh eyes, improve the flow, eliminate leading or confusing questions, and ensure you’ll actually get actionable insights at the end.

I’ve already written a survey, but I need help reviewing it for clarity, bias, fatigue, and whether the responses will actually be useful. Act as a thought partner to guide me step-by-step in tightening the language, removing unnecessary questions, and improving the overall structure. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**1. Project context:**

- **What is the survey about, and who is it for?**

[Insert, e.g., “It’s for current users to understand how they make decisions about upgrades.”]

- **What decisions will the survey inform?**

[Insert, e.g., “Pricing strategy and which features to highlight in marketing.”]

- **What concerns do you have about the survey right now?**

[Insert, e.g., “It feels too long, and I’m not sure the answers will actually help the team take action.”]

**Guide me through reviewing and improving the survey:**

**2. Review for question clarity and neutrality:**

Help me make sure every question is clear, concise, and unbiased.

- Which questions might be confusing, double-barreled, or leading?
- Where could I simplify the language without losing meaning?

**3. Check for respondent fatigue and redundancy:**

Guide me in shortening the survey without losing value.

- Are there questions that don’t directly connect to the goals?
- Is there too much repetition or overly complex formatting?

**4. Assess flow and cognitive load:**

Help me structure the survey so it’s intuitive to take.

- Are similar questions grouped logically?
- Does the survey start with easy/context-setting questions and build from there?

**5. Evaluate answer formats for quality of data:**

Guide me in choosing the right question types for each item.

- Are Likert scales being used appropriately and consistently?
- Are open-ended questions positioned where they’ll add value—not fatigue?

**6. Ensure the questions will lead to action:**

Help me pressure-test whether I’ll be able to use the answers.

- For each question: what decision or analysis will this support?
- Is the data collected qualitative, quantitative, or both—and what does the team need?

**7. Reflection and refinement:**

Help me step back and see if the survey is now tight, useful, and user-friendly:

- Will participants understand and complete this easily?
- Will the data give me insights I can confidently share and act on?
- Are there any final blind spots I might have missed?

Please guide me step-by-step to review and optimize this survey so it’s clearer, shorter, and more likely to produce high-quality, actionable data.

**Follow-up prompts:**

- Help me rewrite 3–5 specific questions I’m unsure about
- Suggest an order for questions that minimizes drop-off
- Recommend a short intro message that sets participant expectations
- Draft a quick checklist to use for reviewing future surveys
- Help me create a summary slide of the survey goals and what each section is intended to measure
