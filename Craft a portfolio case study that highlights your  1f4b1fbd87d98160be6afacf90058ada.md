I need help creating a case study for my user research portfolio that clearly communicates my thinking, process, and impact. Act as a thought partner to guide me step-by-step through reflecting on the project, pulling out the most important details, and structuring the case study for clarity and credibility. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**1. Project context:**

- What was the project or research initiative?

[Insert, e.g., “Discovery work for a new B2B admin dashboard.”]

- What was your role?

[Insert, e.g., “Solo researcher embedded with a cross-functional product team.”]

- What do you want to emphasize in the case study?

[Insert, e.g., “How I influenced product strategy and created alignment across teams.”]

**Guide me through building the case study:**

**2. Clarify the core story**

Help me figure out the key takeaway or narrative.

- What problem was the team facing before research started?
- How did your work shift the direction, reduce risk, or lead to better decisions?

**3. Highlight your thinking and decisions**

Guide me in surfacing the strategy behind the methods.

- Why did you choose the approach you did?
- What trade-offs, constraints, or pivots did you navigate?

**4. Show the process—but keep it focused**

Help me outline just enough of the steps to show how I work.

- What methods did you use and why?
- How did you engage stakeholders or drive alignment?

**5. Emphasize outcomes and impact**

Help me clearly communicate what changed as a result.

- What was different because you did this work?
- How did it shape the product, team, or business?

**6. Make it skimmable and readable**

Guide me in structuring it for someone quickly browsing a portfolio.

- What headers or structure should I use?
- Should I include visuals, quotes, or callouts to guide the reader?

**7. Reflection and refinement**

Help me check that the case study feels strong, clear, and relevant.

- Does it show how I think—not just what I did?
- Will the reader walk away with a sense of my unique contribution?
- Does it align with the type of roles or orgs I want to attract?

Please guide me step-by-step to write a concise, clear, and compelling portfolio case study that showcases my strategic thinking and impact as a researcher.
