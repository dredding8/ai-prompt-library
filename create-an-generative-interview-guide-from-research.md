## **Context:**

When researchers you clear goals but no predefined questions, the TEDW framework (**Tell, Explain, Describe, Walk**) helps generate open-ended, participant-centered questions. This prompt provides structure to brainstorm questions directly from high-level objectives.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to brainstorm interview questions from research goals using the TEDW framework.

“I need help brainstorming interview questions based on my research goals. Use the TEDW framework (**Tell, Explain, Describe, Walk**) to generate exploratory questions that align with my objectives. Guide me step-by-step to create meaningful and open-ended questions.

**Define the research goals:**

What are the main objectives of this research?

Examples:

- “Understand how users engage with our product’s onboarding process.”
- “Explore the motivations behind users choosing competitors’ features.”
- “Identify pain points in users’ daily workflows related to [product].”

**Break goals into sub-themes:**

- What specific areas or steps are part of this goal?
- Where might there be opportunities to uncover insights?
    - Example Sub-Themes for “Understand how users engage with our product’s onboarding process”:
        - Initial impressions of onboarding.
        - Expectations before starting onboarding.
        - Challenges during onboarding.
        - Outcomes and success after completing onboarding.

**Use TEDW to generate questions:**

For each sub-theme, brainstorm exploratory questions using the TEDW framework.

- **Tell me about:** Ask participants to share stories or experiences.
    - Example: “Tell me about the last time you used onboarding for a new product.”
- **Explain:** Encourage participants to articulate their reasoning or decisions.
    - Example: “Explain what you expected to happen when you started onboarding.”
- **Describe:** Ask participants to provide detailed depictions of their experience.
    - Example: “Describe how you felt as you moved through the onboarding steps.”
- **Walk me through:** Guide participants to step through a process in detail.
    - Example: “Walk me through the process of setting up your account during onboarding.”

## **Reflection questions**

- Are the questions clear, unbiased, and free of jargon?
- Do they align with the research goals and sub-themes?
- Will they encourage detailed, meaningful responses from participants?
- Have I explored all relevant sub-themes to meet the research objectives?
- Are these questions open-ended enough to allow participants to share unexpected insights?
- Are follow-up prompts needed to dig deeper during interviews?

Please generate a complete interview guide based on my goals and this structure using the TEDW framework to ensure rich and meaningful responses.”

## **Follow-Up Prompts:**

- “Suggest additional sub-themes I might be missing for my goal.”
- “Write follow-up probes for the TEDW questions brainstormed using the five-why’s technique or open-ended questions.”
- “Propose ways to test these questions with colleagues or in a pilot session.”
- “Help prioritize the most critical questions if time is limited.”
