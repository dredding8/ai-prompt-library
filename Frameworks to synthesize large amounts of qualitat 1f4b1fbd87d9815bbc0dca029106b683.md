## **Context:**

When working with unstructured qualitative data, it can feel overwhelming to distill key themes and insights. This prompt helps you explore popular synthesis frameworks like affinity mapping and thematic analysis, guiding you to select the best approach based on your research needs.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help synthesizing large amounts of qualitative data.

“I’m struggling to synthesize a large amount of qualitative data and need help selecting frameworks, organizing the information, and identifying actionable themes. Act as a thought partner to guide me step-by-step through this process. Assume I’m starting from scratch. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**Project context:**

- **What type of qualitative data are you working with?**

[Insert details, e.g., “Transcripts from 20 user interviews and 100 open-ended survey responses.”]

- **What are the research goals or questions this data should address?**

[Insert details, e.g., “To understand user frustrations with the onboarding process and identify improvement opportunities.”]

- **What decisions or outcomes will the synthesis support?**

[Insert details, e.g., “Prioritizing features for redesign in the next sprint.”]

**Define the purpose of synthesis:**

Help me clarify what I’m trying to achieve with the synthesis.

- What are the main outcomes I want to uncover (e.g., themes, insights, or user needs)?
- How can I ensure the synthesis aligns with the research goals and stakeholder expectations?

**Select appropriate frameworks:**

Guide me in choosing the right frameworks to organize and analyze the data.

- What frameworks should I consider (e.g., affinity mapping, thematic analysis, journey mapping)?
- How can I decide which framework is best suited to my data and goals?

**Organize and structure the data:**

Help me think through how to organize the raw data into a usable format.

- What steps should I take to extract, sort, and categorize key pieces of information?
- How can I create clusters or groupings that make patterns easier to identify?

**Identify themes and patterns:**

Guide me in uncovering meaningful patterns or themes in the data.

- What questions should I ask myself to identify recurring ideas, behaviors, or pain points?
- How can I handle conflicting data or outliers?

**Synthesize insights:**

Help me transform patterns into actionable insights.

- How should I articulate the key takeaways in a way that is clear and actionable?
- How can I ensure that the insights connect back to the research goals and stakeholder needs?

**Visualize the findings:**

Guide me in presenting the synthesis in a clear and engaging format.

- What visual tools (e.g., charts, journey maps, affinity diagrams) could help communicate the findings?
- How can I organize the presentation to make it easy for stakeholders to understand and act on the insights?

## Reflection questions:

- Does this framework help me focus on the key insights stakeholders care about?
- Am I missing alternative frameworks that might reveal different perspectives?
- Do the themes or clusters I’ve identified clearly address my research goals?
- How can I ensure the synthesis process avoids personal bias or overgeneralization?
- What additional steps can I take to validate the findings (e.g., cross-checking with team members)?

## Summarize findings for stakeholders:

Provide guidance for turning the synthesized data into a deliverable, such as:

- A presentation summarizing key themes and their supporting evidence.
- A visual map (e.g., affinity diagram, journey map) to show relationships between themes.
- A written report with actionable recommendations.

Please expand this into a comprehensive guide for synthesizing unstructured qualitative data, ensuring the process is actionable and results in clear, stakeholder-ready insights.”

## **Follow-Up Prompts:**

- “Draft a visual representation of the synthesized findings using the selected framework (e.g., a labeled affinity map or journey map).”
- “What steps can I take to cross-check my findings and ensure themes are accurate and unbiased?”
- “Summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the framework I chose and suggest alternatives for future synthesis projects.”
- “Write a stakeholder-facing summary of the key themes and their implications, formatted as a one-pager.”
- “Suggest how I might combine two frameworks (e.g., affinity mapping and journey mapping) to deepen the insights.”
