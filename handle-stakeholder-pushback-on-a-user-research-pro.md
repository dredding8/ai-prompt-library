Category: Stakeholder management
Information needed?: Starting from scratch

## **Context:**

Stakeholder pushback can create challenges for user researchers, whether it’s skepticism about the project’s value, disagreements on methods, or resistance to findings. This prompt provides structured guidance to help you respond effectively, foster alignment, and build trust with stakeholders.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help managing stakeholder pushback.

“I’m facing pushback from stakeholders about a user research project. Guide me step-by-step to respond effectively, clarify concerns, and align on a path forward. Assume I need practical suggestions and examples to handle different types of resistance.

**Understand the pushback:**

I’m not entirely sure why stakeholders are pushing back. Suggest questions or strategies to identify their concerns.

- How can I uncover the root causes of their resistance (e.g., time, budget, value, or priorities)?
- What questions can I ask to ensure I fully understand their perspective?

**Address skepticism about the project’s value:**

How can I demonstrate the importance of this research?

- Suggest ways to explain how the project aligns with business goals or solves specific problems.
- What examples or data can I use to make the case for its impact?

**Respond to disagreements on methods:**

What should I do if stakeholders disagree with the chosen research methods?

- How can I explain why the selected methods are appropriate for the goals?
- What strategies can I use to involve stakeholders in shaping the approach without compromising research rigor?

**Navigate resistance to findings:**

What if stakeholders are resistant to the findings or recommendations?

- Suggest ways to present findings in a way that resonates with their priorities.
- How can I handle questions or challenges about the validity of the data?

**Build alignment:**

What steps can I take to foster alignment and build trust with stakeholders?

- Suggest strategies for involving stakeholders earlier in the research process.
- How can I position myself as a thought partner rather than an adversary?

## **Reflection questions:**

Help me reflect on my approach to ensure I’m addressing the pushback constructively:

- Have I clearly linked the research to business or stakeholder goals?
- Am I addressing concerns empathetically while maintaining research integrity?
- What adjustments can I make to increase stakeholder buy-in?

Please provide step-by-step guidance for responding to stakeholder pushback effectively, including practical suggestions for handling common challenges and fostering alignment.”

## **Follow-up prompts:**

- “Draft an email or presentation to address stakeholder concerns about the project.”
- “Propose ways to reframe the research project to better align with stakeholder priorities.”
- “Suggest strategies for presenting findings to resistant stakeholders.”
- “Create a checklist for maintaining stakeholder trust and buy-in throughout the project.”
- “Help me prepare for a meeting where I anticipate pushback from stakeholders.”
