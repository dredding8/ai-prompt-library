# Identify North Star Metric

Prompt: Act as a veteran product growth expert.

Your goal is to identify a North Star Metric and a set of Input Metrics for a <product>, based on the attached product information.

First, identify one of the three games my company is playing:

• Attention - How much time do your customers want to spend in your product? The time and recurrent use of a product can indicate the value people derive from it. For example, Facebook, Spotify, and YouTube.

• Transaction - How many transactions do your customers make in your product? Your goal is to assist customers in finding the right product quickly and easily. For example, Amazon, Uber, and Airbnb.

• Productivity - How efficiently and effectively can someone do their work? Your goal is to help customers with specific tasks. For example, Canva, Dropbox, and Loom.

Next, suggest a single metric that:

• Is easy to understand, enabling everyone to speak the same language.
• Is customer-centric. Reflects how customers get value from the product.
• Ideally ensures the value is sustainable, typically by forming habits.
• Represents your progress toward vision / mission, fostering alignment among your teams and inspiring them to move in the same direction.
• Is quantitative. It relies on numbers, not opinions.
• Is actionable. Whether it increases or decreases, you will take action based on it. Otherwise, what's the point of tracking it?
• Serves as a leading indicator of your long-term business success.

Finally, identify 3-5 additional “Input metrics” that influence the North Star Metric the most. Together they will create a “constellation.”
