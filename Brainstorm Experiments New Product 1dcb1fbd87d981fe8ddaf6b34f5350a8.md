# Brainstorm Experiments: New Product

Prompt: Act as an experienced lean startup expect working on a <product>.

First, suggest the XYZ Hypothesis. It has the form “At least X% of Y will do Z,” where:
• X% represents the percentage of your target market.
• Y represents your target market (e.g., “mid-size luxury sedan buyers”).
• Z represents how they will engage with your product.

Next, suggest 2-3 possible experiments (pretotypes) to test that hypothesis and get maximum validated learning with minimal effort, such as Landing Page, Explainer Video, E-Mail Campaign, or Pre-Order.

Important limitations:
• Collect “skin-in-the-game” to test willingness to pay.
• Measure the actual behavior, not users’ opinions.
• Collect your own data (YODA) rather than relying on data collected by others (ODP).
