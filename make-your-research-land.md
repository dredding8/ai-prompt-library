**Context:**

You’ve done the work—now it’s time to make sure your research *drives action.* This prompt helps you plan and run a research readout that connects the dots between insights and next steps. It helps you engage stakeholders, deliver clear takeaways, and prompt real decisions—not just polite head nods.

**Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help preparing a research readout that sparks alignment and action.

I need help preparing a research readout that doesn’t just summarize what we found, but drives actual decisions or next steps. Act as a thought partner to guide me step-by-step in structuring the content, tailoring it to my audience, and planning how to deliver it effectively. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**1. Project context:**

- **What was the research about?**

[Insert details, e.g., “Testing a new onboarding experience for first-time users.”]

- **Who is the audience for the readout?**

[Insert roles, e.g., “PMs, designers, engineers, and a few cross-functional leads.”]

- **What outcomes or decisions do you hope this readout will support?**

[Insert goals, e.g., “Prioritizing fixes before launch and agreeing on what to test next.”]

**Guide me through preparing an actionable readout:**

**2. Clarify the goal of the readout:**

Help me get clear on what this readout is *for*.

- What specific actions or alignment do I want from this meeting?
- What questions should I be answering—or prompting?

**3. Prioritize what to share:**

Guide me in choosing the most important takeaways.

- What are the 3–5 things people *must* walk away understanding?
- How can I avoid drowning the audience in too much detail?

**4. Structure the readout for flow and engagement:**

Help me organize the content clearly and effectively.

•	What’s the best order to share insights in—build up to a point, or lead with the headline?

•	How can I break up the content to keep energy and attention high?

**5. Connect insights to decisions:**

Help me make the takeaways usable and actionable.

- How can I clearly show “what this means” for the product, roadmap, or design?
- What’s the simplest way to frame recommendations or options?

**6. Facilitate discussion and alignment:**

Guide me in running the actual session smoothly.

- What should I ask to invite input without derailing?
- How do I create space for questions *and* momentum toward next steps?

**7. Reflection and refinement:**

Help me make sure this readout is action-oriented and memorable:

- Will the audience know what to do after this session?
- Have I been clear, compelling, and grounded in evidence?
- Is there a clear takeaway or call to action?

Please guide me step-by-step in preparing and delivering a research readout that doesn’t just inform—but drives action, decisions, and clarity for the team.

**Follow-up prompts:**

- Help me create a one-slide summary that highlights key takeaways and recommendations
- Draft an intro that grabs attention and frames the purpose of the session
- Suggest visual formats to make the insights more memorable (e.g., patterns, journeys, flows)
- Propose a facilitation plan for a 30- or 60-minute readout
- Help me write a follow-up message summarizing decisions and next steps
