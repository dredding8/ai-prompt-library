# Create a quantitative research plan to evaluate qualitative insights

Category: Methods
Information needed?: Information needed

## **Context:**

Opportunity gap surveys measure the importance of specific attributes and satisfaction with current solutions, helping to prioritize areas for improvement. This prompt helps you design a quantitative research plan using opportunity gap surveys to evaluate and generalize qualitative findings across a broader sample.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help creating a quantitative research plan.

“I need help creating a quantitative research plan to evaluate qualitative insights. Act as a thought partner and guide me step-by-step in defining goals, framing key questions, and designing an actionable plan. Assume I’m starting from scratch. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**Project context:**

- **What are the qualitative insights you want to evaluate?**

[Insert details, e.g., “Users feel overwhelmed by the number of options in the app’s navigation.”]

- **What product, feature, or experience does the research focus on?**

[Insert details, e.g., “The app’s main menu and navigation system.”]

- **What are the stakeholders’ goals or priorities?**

[Insert details, e.g., “To identify which navigation options to streamline and measure the impact on usability and satisfaction.”]

**Define the purpose of the quantitative research:**

Help me clarify what this research aims to achieve.

- What specific insights or hypotheses from the qualitative data need further evaluation?
- How can I define measurable outcomes that align with stakeholders’ goals?

 **Identify key research questions:**

Guide me in translating qualitative insights into quantitative questions.

- How can I frame questions to confirm patterns or test hypotheses from the qualitative findings?
- What metrics (e.g., satisfaction, task success rate) could help evaluate these questions?

**Choose appropriate methods:**

Help me select the right quantitative methods for the project.

- What methods should I consider (e.g., surveys, usability tests, A/B tests)?
- How can I determine the best approach to collect meaningful, measurable data?

**Define the target audience:**

Guide me in identifying the audience for the research.

- Who should participate to ensure the data is representative?
- How can I ensure alignment between the target audience for the quantitative study and the qualitative insights?

**Plan the data collection and analysis:**

Help me outline how to collect and analyze the data effectively.

- What steps should I take to design and distribute the data collection instrument (e.g., survey or testing setup)?
- What strategies can I use to analyze the data and link it back to the qualitative insights?

## Reflection questions:

- Are the opportunity gap survey questions directly linked to the qualitative insights?
- Do the questions provide clear, measurable data on both importance and satisfaction?
- Is the sample size and diversity sufficient to generalize findings?
- Will the data clearly prioritize areas for improvement based on opportunity gaps?
- Have I accounted for stakeholder goals in the survey design and analysis?

Please expand this into a detailed research plan, including survey questions, data collection methods, sample size requirements, and an analysis framework.”

## **Follow-Up Prompts:**

- “Write a summary of how opportunity gaps were calculated and their implications for product improvements.”
- “Propose additional survey questions to explore themes that were not covered in the qualitative findings.”
- “Draft a stakeholder-facing document to explain the opportunity gap survey methodology and findings.”
- “Suggest metrics or KPIs to track progress in addressing the identified opportunity gaps over time.”
