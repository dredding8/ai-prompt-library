“I need help creating an interview script for a journey mapping project. Act as a thought partner to guide me step-by-step through brainstorming questions, structuring the script, and aligning it with the goals of the research. Assume I’m starting from scratch. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**Project context:**

- **What process, task, or experience is the journey map focusing on?**

[Insert details, e.g., “The process of onboarding to a project management app.”]

- **Who are the participants?**

[Insert participant details, e.g., “New users who signed up for the app in the past month.”]

- **What are the goals of the journey mapping project?**

[Insert goals, e.g., “To identify pain points and areas for improvement in the onboarding process.”]

**Define the objectives of the interview:**

Help me clarify what I need to learn from the participants.

- What aspects of the journey should I focus on (e.g., actions, emotions, challenges)?

How can I ensure the interview goals align with the journey map’s purpose?

**Brainstorm key areas to explore:**

Guide me in identifying the themes or stages the questions should cover.

- How can I uncover the participant’s expectations before starting the journey?
- What types of questions should I ask to explore each stage of the journey (e.g., decision points, pain points, emotional highs and lows)?

**Craft meaningful questions:**

Help me brainstorm and refine questions to encourage open and honest responses.

- How can I use open-ended, non-leading questions to uncover rich details about the participant’s experience?
- How can I adapt the TEDW framework (tell, explain, describe, walk) to create insightful questions?

**Structure the interview script:**

Guide me in organizing the questions into a logical and engaging flow.

- How should I start the session to set participants at ease and introduce the journey mapping exercise?
- What is the best way to transition between journey stages or topics?
- How can I leave room for follow-up questions or spontaneous insights?

**Prepare for probing deeper:**

Help me craft follow-up prompts to explore responses further.

- What strategies can I use to encourage participants to elaborate on their answers?
- How can I probe for more detail without biasing their responses?

## **Reflection and refinement:**

Help me reflect on whether the interview script is comprehensive and aligned with my goals:

- Does the script cover all key aspects of the participant’s journey?
- Are the questions designed to uncover actionable insights?
- What additional steps can I take to test and refine the script before conducting interviews?

Please guide me step-by-step to create an interview script that captures rich and detailed insights for a journey map, ensuring the process is clear, engaging, and aligned with my project goals.”

## **Follow-up prompts:**

- “Suggest tools or templates to document the journey map based on the interview insights.”
- “Help me draft a script introduction to explain the purpose of the interview to participants.”
- “Propose ways to pilot the script with a colleague or sample participant.”
- “Create a checklist to ensure the interview script is clear, unbiased, and comprehensive.”
- “Suggest strategies for visualizing the journey map based on the interview data.”
