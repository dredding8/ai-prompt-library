# Create a workshop for analyzing research sessions

Category: Analysis, Workshop
Information needed?: Information needed

## **Context:**

Analysis workshops bring teams together to synthesize research data, identify patterns, and generate actionable insights. This prompt helps you design a workshop agenda that engages participants, organizes findings, and aligns on key takeaways and recommendations.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to create a collaborative and effective analysis workshop agenda.

“I need help designing a workshop for analyzing research sessions. The workshop should bring the team together to synthesize data, identify patterns, and agree on key insights and next steps. Guide me step-by-step to create a structured agenda.

**Define the purpose of the workshop:**

- What is the goal of the analysis?
    - Example: “To identify common themes from usability testing sessions and prioritize areas for improvement.”
- Who will participate in the workshop?
    - Example: “Researchers, designers, product managers, and other key stakeholders.”

**Outline the workshop structure:**

What activities will help the team collaborate and generate insights?

1.  **Icebreaker and Recap (10-15 minutes):** Get participants engaged and provide context for the workshop.
- Icebreaker activity: “Share one surprising or memorable moment from the research sessions.”
- Recap the research purpose and methods:
- “What were the research objectives, and what sessions did we conduct?”
1.  **Data Sharing (20-30 minutes):** Review key observations from the research sessions.
- Activity: Observation Sharing
- Ask participants to share 2-3 key observations or quotes from the sessions.
- Use sticky notes (physical or digital) to capture and display the data.
- Output: A visible wall of raw observations.
1. **Clustering and Theming (30-40 minutes):** Group related observations to uncover patterns.
- Activity: Affinity Mapping
- Group similar observations into clusters based on themes.
- Label each cluster with a potential theme.
- Output: A set of labeled themes that represent key findings.
1.  **Insight Generation (20-30 minutes):** Turn themes into actionable insights.
- Activity: Insight Mapping. For each theme, ask:
    - “What does this tell us about user needs or pain points?”
    - “What are the implications for our product or service?”
- Write insights on a shared board or document.
- Output: A list of actionable insights linked to the themes.
1. **Prioritization and Next Steps (15-20 minutes):** Align on the most critical findings and plan next steps.
- Activity: Prioritization Exercise
- Ask: “Which insights have the biggest impact on our goals or users?”
- Use methods like dot voting or an impact-effort matrix.
- Output: A prioritized list of insights and a plan for follow-up actions.

## Reflection questions:

- Does the workshop structure provide a clear path from data to insights?
- Are all team members engaged in the analysis process?
- Are the outputs actionable and aligned with the original research objectives?
- Is there enough time allocated to clustering, theming, and insight generation?

Please expand this into a detailed workshop agenda with step-by-step instructions, questions, and desired outputs for each phase.”

## **Follow-Up Prompts:**

- “Draft a slide deck to guide the team through each workshop activity.”
- “Write a summary email to share the workshop outputs and prioritized insights with stakeholders.”
- “Suggest alternative methods for clustering and theming, such as user journey mapping or frameworks.”
- “Propose a checklist of materials and tools needed to facilitate the workshop effectively.”
- “Draft a brief reflection activity for the team at the end of the workshop to evaluate the process.”
