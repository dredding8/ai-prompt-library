## **Context:**

You’ve completed qualitative research and now need to present your findings in a way that’s engaging, clear, and actionable. Use this prompt to create a narrative structure that highlights key themes, supports them with evidence, and connects to stakeholder priorities.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM. Fill in the placeholders to generate a clear and actionable narrative structure for your insights.

“I need help turning qualitative research insights into a compelling narrative that highlights key themes and drives stakeholder action. Follow these steps to structure the insights:

**Define the audience and purpose:**

- Who will this narrative be shared with?
    - Example: Stakeholders from product, design, or leadership.
- What decision or action should this narrative inform?
    
    -Example: Prioritize improvements to a specific user journey or feature.
    

**Identify the key themes from the data:**

- List 3-5 major themes or patterns from your research:
    - Theme 1: [Insert key theme, e.g., “Users struggle with onboarding tasks.”]
    - Theme 2: [Insert another theme, e.g., “Users value X feature but find it hard to locate.”]

**Support each theme with evidence:**

Add supporting quotes or observations for each theme:

- Example for Theme 1:
    - Quote: “I couldn’t figure out what to do on the first screen.”
    - Observation: 80% of participants failed to complete onboarding.

Ensure evidence is specific and aligns with the theme.

**Create a story arc:**

Start with the problem or tension:

- Example: “Many users drop off during onboarding, and they feel frustrated by unclear instructions.”

Introduce themes as discoveries:

- Example: “Our research uncovered three key barriers to onboarding success: confusion on the first screen, unclear instructions, and a lack of visual guidance.”

End with actionable recommendations:

- Example: “Based on these findings, we recommend simplifying the first screen, adding tooltips to clarify instructions, and redesigning the onboarding flow to include a progress indicator.”

## Reflect on the narrative:

- Is the narrative compelling enough to inspire action, or does it need more urgency?
- Does the sequence of themes naturally build toward the recommendations, or do I need to reorder for better flow?
- What biases might I have in selecting these themes or framing the findings? How can I balance or test those assumptions?
- Are the insights too granular or too abstract for this audience? How can I adjust the level of detail?
- How can I use participant quotes or anecdotes to make the insights more relatable and memorable?
- Does the narrative include enough actionable next steps, or do I need to connect insights more directly to stakeholder priorities?
- Am I unintentionally excluding themes or findings that challenge the stakeholders’ assumptions? How can I bring those forward constructively?
- What’s the single most important takeaway I want stakeholders to remember, and is it clear in the narrative?

Please expand this into a structured narrative I can present to stakeholders, ensuring each theme is supported by evidence and linked to actionable next steps.”

## **Follow-Up Prompts:**

- “Summarize the key themes and recommendations into a one-pager for busy stakeholders.”
- “Create a presentation outline based on this narrative, focusing on the key insights and actions.”
- “Suggest visualizations (e.g., charts, journey maps) that would strengthen the impact of the story.”
- “Provide an alternative framing of the narrative to appeal to a different stakeholder group, such as executives or developers.”
- “Identify gaps in the data or evidence that might weaken the narrative and suggest ways to address them.”
