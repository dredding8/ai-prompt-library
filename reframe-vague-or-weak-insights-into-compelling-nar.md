# Reframe vague or weak insights into compelling narratives

Category: Reporting, Synthesis
Information needed?: Some information needed

**Context:**

Not all insights land the first time. Sometimes what you’ve got feels too vague, obvious, or disconnected from real action. This prompt helps you strengthen, clarify, and reframe weak insights so they resonate with your audience and inspire decision-making.

**Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help sharpening weak or vague insights into stronger, clearer narratives.

I need help turning a set of vague or unconvincing insights into stronger, more actionable narratives. Act as a thought partner to guide me step-by-step in refining the language, tightening the structure, and making the insights more impactful for my team. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**1. Project context:**

- **What kind of research was this based on?**

[Insert details, e.g., “8 customer interviews and 2 usability tests on a new scheduling feature.”]

- **Who are the stakeholders or audience for these insights?**

[Insert details, e.g., “Product and engineering leads planning the next sprint.”]

- **What’s the general issue with the insights now?**

[Insert concerns, e.g., “They feel too general or hard to act on. Some just state observations, not implications.”]

**Guide me through strengthening these insights:**

**2. Identify what’s missing from the weak insight:**

Help me break down what makes the current version ineffective.

- Is it too broad, too obvious, or not tied to user goals?
- Is it missing tension, stakes, or implications?
- Does it need more clarity, evidence, or direction?

**3. Rebuild the insight with structure and clarity:**

Guide me in rewriting the insight to make it sharper.

- How can I use a structure like: *Observation → Implication → Recommendation*?
- What verbs or framing can I use to make it feel more active and directional?

**4. Anchor it in evidence and context:**

Help me strengthen the credibility of the insight.

- What specific data or quotes can I bring in to support it?
- How do I add just enough evidence without overwhelming the message?

**5. Connect it to what matters:**

Guide me in tying the insight to stakeholder goals or product decisions.

- What decision does this insight inform or unblock?
- How can I frame it to show value or urgency?

**6. Create alternative versions for testing:**

Help me write a few variations and pressure-test them.

- What’s a short version for a slide or headline?
- What’s a narrative version that would work in a readout or doc?
- What’s a version that’s direct and tactical?

**7. Reflection and refinement:**

Help me evaluate whether the reframed insights are stronger:

- Do they clearly communicate a user need, pain point, or opportunity?
- Would a stakeholder reading this know what to do next?
- Are the insights still accurate, balanced, and grounded in the data?

Please guide me step-by-step to rework weak or unclear insights into strong, credible, and action-oriented narratives that are easier to understand, use, and share.

**Follow-up prompts:**

- Help me reword three weak insights into stronger, more specific versions
- Suggest storytelling frameworks I can use for insight-driven narratives
- Draft before-and-after examples of insight reframing
- Propose a checklist to self-review insights before sharing them
- Recommend tactics to test insight resonance with stakeholders before a readout
