# Choose the right survey type for your research goals

Category: Methods
Information needed?: Starting from scratch

## **Context:**

Choosing the right survey type is crucial for gathering actionable insights. This prompt helps you determine the best survey type—such as MaxDiff, conjoint analysis, or satisfaction measures using SEQ or UMUX—to align with your research goals and evaluate user experiences.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to identify the best survey type for your research.

“I need help selecting the most appropriate survey type for my research objectives. Guide me step-by-step to define my goals, evaluate survey options, and choose the best fit for my needs.

**Define the research goals:**

- What is the primary objective of this survey?
    - Example: “To understand which features users value most and assess their satisfaction with a specific process.”
- What type of decisions or actions will the survey inform?
    - Example: “Prioritize new features and refine existing workflows for better usability.”

**Outline the insights you need:**

Do you need to:

- Evaluate trade-offs between options? (e.g., feature prioritization, pricing preferences)
- Measure perceptions of your brand? (e.g., brand awareness, sentiment, or differentiation)
- Assess user satisfaction with specific tasks or overall usability?

**Select the appropriate survey type:**

**MaxDiff Survey:** Use this to rank or prioritize options when users have multiple choices.

- Best for: Identifying which features, benefits, or attributes users value most.
- Example Question: “Which of the following app features is most important to you and which is least important?”
- Ideal when: You have a list of features or ideas to prioritize.

**Conjoint Analysis:** Use this to evaluate trade-offs between multiple attributes of a product or service.

- Best for: Testing combinations of features, prices, or benefits to see what users prioritize.
- Example Question: “Which of these options align with your goals?”
    - Option 1: $10/month, includes basic analytics.
    - Option 2: $15/month, includes advanced analytics and offline mode.
- Ideal when: You need to assess how users make decisions across complex trade-offs.

**Brand Sentiment Survey:** Use this to measure how users perceive your brand.

- Best for: Gauging trust, awareness, and alignment with user values.
- Example Question: “How strongly do you agree with the statement: ‘[Brand Name] aligns with my goals and needs’?”
- Ideal when: You want to assess brand positioning or emotional connection.

**Satisfaction Measures (SEQ or UMUX):** Use these to measure task-specific or overall usability satisfaction.

- **Single Ease Question (SEQ):**
    - Best for: Assessing satisfaction with a specific task.
    - Example Question: “How difficult or easy was it to [complete a specific task]?”
        - Answer scale: Very Difficult (1) to Very Easy (7).
- **Usability Metric for User Experience (UMUX):**
    - Best for: Measuring perceived usability with a standard set of questions.
    - Example Questions:
        - “The system’s capabilities meet my requirements.”
        - “This system is easy to use.”
    - Answer scale: Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly Agree (7).

## Reflection questions:

- Does the selected survey type align with my research goals and target audience?
- Will the chosen method provide clear, actionable insights for decision-making?
- Are the questions in the selected method unbiased and easy for participants to understand?
- Do I have the tools and resources to design and analyze this survey type effectively?

Please expand this into a detailed survey plan, including the chosen survey type, example questions, and the intended outcomes.”

## **Follow-Up Prompts:**

- “Write a short explanation of why the SEQ or UMUX was chosen for satisfaction measurement.”
- “Suggest additional survey types that could complement the selected survey for deeper insights.”
- “Propose a timeline for designing, distributing, and analyzing the survey results.”
- “Draft a checklist for ensuring clarity and relevance in the survey design.”
- “Create a guide for interpreting and presenting the results of SEQ or UMUX to stakeholders.”
