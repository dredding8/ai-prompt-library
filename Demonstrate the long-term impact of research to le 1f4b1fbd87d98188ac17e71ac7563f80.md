**Context:**

Research often drives critical decisions—but those impacts aren’t always obvious months later. This prompt helps you trace the ripple effects of your past work, organize outcomes, and communicate the long-term strategic value of user research to leadership.

I need help demonstrating the long-term impact of user research to leadership. Act as a thought partner to guide me step-by-step through identifying where research has made a difference over time, how to organize and frame those examples, and how to tell a compelling story about the value of research across the org. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**1. Project context:**

- What past research projects are you reflecting on?

[Insert, e.g., “Foundational discovery work from 6 months ago on user workflows.”]

- What kind of impact are you hoping to highlight?

[Insert, e.g., “How that work led to product strategy shifts and internal tooling updates.”]

- Who is the audience for this story or presentation?

[Insert, e.g., “VP of Product and other senior leaders.”]

**Guide me through surfacing long-term research impact:**

**2. Trace the chain of influence**

Help me look backward and identify where research has shaped outcomes.

- What decisions, product changes, or strategy shifts came after this research?
- What deliverables or artifacts have continued to be referenced or reused?

**3. Frame the impact clearly and credibly**

Guide me in articulating the value in a way that resonates with leadership.

- How can I link research outcomes to product, business, or user success?
- What kind of language will land best with execs (e.g., outcomes, efficiency, de-risking)?

**4. Pull in both quantitative and qualitative evidence**

Help me gather signals that show research made a difference.

- What usage data, adoption metrics, or engagement shifts can I point to?
- Have I collected feedback from internal stakeholders about the value of the work?

**5. Create a concise story arc**

Guide me in turning this into a compelling narrative.

- How can I structure this like a case study (problem → research → impact)?
- How do I keep the story high-level while still showing substance?

**6. Prepare formats for sharing**

Help me decide how to package this story.

- Is this best as a one-pager, slide deck, or spoken summary?
- What visuals or quotes could make it more persuasive?

**7. Reflection and refinement**

Help me evaluate whether this shows the full picture of research’s impact.

- Have I captured both immediate wins and longer-term ripple effects?
- Would a stakeholder recognize the value clearly and quickly?
- What follow-up stories could I share over time to reinforce this message?

Please guide me step-by-step to craft a story about the long-term impact of research that’s credible, concise, and aligned with leadership priorities.

**Follow-up prompts:**

- Help me write a one-pager that summarizes this story
- Suggest ways to visualize the timeline or chain of influence
- Create a few slides I could include in a quarterly business review
- Propose language to describe the strategic value of research without sounding too fluffy
- Help me write a thank-you or recognition message to share with partners who contributed to the project
