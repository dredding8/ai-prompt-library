Lean Canvas Template

1. Product

1.1. Problem

Identify the problem or need that your product is aiming to solve. You might want to start by thinking about your target customers and the challenges they face.

For example, if you're developing a travel app, your target customers might struggle to find affordable and reliable transportation options in unfamiliar places.

1.2 Solution

Describe how your product solves the problem you identified in the previous section. Make sure to highlight the unique features and benefits of your solution.

For example, if your travel app connects users with local drivers, you might emphasize the convenience and safety of this service.

1.3 Key Metrics

Choose the key metrics that will help you track the success of your product. These might include metrics such as customer acquisition cost, conversion rate, and customer lifetime value.

For example, if you're developing a social media platform, you might track the number of daily active users and the engagement rate of each post.

1.4 Cost Structure

Identify the costs of developing, producing, and delivering your product or service. This might include expenses such as marketing, research and development, and customer support.

For example, if you're developing a software application, you might need to factor in the cost of servers/cloud infrastructure.

2. Unique Value Proposition

Clearly articulate what sets your product or service apart from others in the market. What problems do you solve way better than any other product? This might include features such as unique technology, a better user experience, or superior customer service.

For example, if you're developing a meal delivery service, you might emphasize the freshness and quality of your ingredients.

3. Market

3.1 Unfair Advantage

Identify any advantage that your business has over its competitors. This might include exclusive partnerships, proprietary technology, or a strong brand reputation.

For example, if you're developing a ride-sharing app, you might have an unfair advantage if you have secured exclusive partnerships with major transportation providers.

3.2 Channels

Describe how you will market and deliver your product or service to your target customers. This might include channels such as social media, email marketing, or influencer partnerships.

For example, if you're developing a travel app, you might leverage social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook to reach potential customers.

3.3 Customer Segments

Identify the specific groups of people or businesses that your product or service is intended for. This might include geographic location, industry, and job title.

For example, if you're developing booking software, your customer segments might include small business owners that offer activities such as bungee jumping, walking tours, or escape rooms.

3.4 Revenue Streams

Describe the different ways in which your business will generate revenue from your product or service. This might include sources such as subscriptions, advertising, or one-time purchases.

For example, if you're developing a music streaming platform, your revenue streams might include subscription fees and targeted advertising.
