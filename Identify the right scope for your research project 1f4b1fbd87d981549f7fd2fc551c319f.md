# Identify the right scope for your research project

Category: Planning
Information needed?: Information needed

## **Context:**

A poorly scoped research project can lead to wasted time, unclear findings, or incomplete answers. This prompt helps you identify the right scope by balancing stakeholder needs, available time, and resources.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this structure into your LLM. Use the reflection prompts to refine the scope as needed.

“I’m planning a research project around [insert topic, e.g., ‘understanding user needs for a new dashboard feature’]. Help me define the appropriate scope:

## **State the purpose of the research**:

- What is the overarching goal or decision this research supports?
    - Example: ‘To identify which dashboard features users value most.’

## **List all possible research questions**:

- What are all the questions I could explore?
    - Question 1: [Insert]
    - Question 2: [Insert]

## **Narrow down the scope**:

- Which 1-3 questions are most critical to answer now?
    - Example: ‘What features do users find most useful?’

## **Reflection questions**:

- If I had only half the time or resources, what would I focus on?
- Am I tackling a question that’s too broad to answer in this timeframe?
- Am I trying to solve too many problems at once? What’s the single most important question to answer?
- If this scope were cut in half, what would I focus on to deliver the most value?
- What’s the risk of scoping too broadly or too narrowly? How can I find the balance?
- What constraints (time, resources, stakeholder needs) are influencing this scope, and are they realistic?

## **Summarize the final scope**:

Write a 1-2 sentence statement:

- ‘The scope of this research is to [insert focus] to help stakeholders [insert decision or outcome].’

Please organize this into a clear research scope, prioritizing key questions and excluding anything unnecessary.”

**Follow-up Prompts:**

1. “What risks or trade-offs come with this scope? Suggest ways to address them.”
2. “What questions am I missing that might be more important than the ones I shared? Suggest 1-2 other critical questions.”
3. “Summarize the research scope into a 1-page outline to share with stakeholders.”
4. “Draft a scope statement that clearly outlines what is **in scope** and what is explicitly **out of scope**.”
5. “Summarize the project scope into a one-pager to share with stakeholders for sign-off.”
6. “Identify 1-2 methods that would allow me to gather insights quickly within this scope.”
7. “What’s one key metric or deliverable I can use to ensure this scoped research meets its goals?”
