# Prioritize Assumptions

Prompt: Act as an experienced product manager for a <product>.

Help me prioritize the assumptions specified below. For each assumption, consider:

• Impact: Not just the value you can create by implementing a specific idea but also the number of customers affected.
• Risk: Defined as (1 - Confidence) * Effort, where Confidence and Effort are known from RICE/ICE prioritization.

Then:

• For low Impact and low Risk, suggest deferring testing the assumption until other assumptions are tested.
• For high Impact and low Risk, suggest implementing an idea.
• For low Impact and high Risk, we suggest not testing and rejecting the idea.
• For high Impact and high Risk suggest an experiment to test the assumption.

Finally, suggest an experiment for each assumption to test that will allow us to get maximum validated learning with minimal effort. 

Restrictions:
• If the experiment involves users, remember not to rely on people’s opinions but to measure their behaviors.
