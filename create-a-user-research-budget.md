“I need help creating an annual user research budget that covers multiple projects, resources, and activities for the year. Act as a thought partner to guide me step-by-step in identifying key cost areas, structuring the budget, and aligning it with organizational goals. Assume I’m starting from scratch. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**Organizational context:**

- **What is the total number of projects or research initiatives planned for the year?**

[Insert details, e.g., “Five major projects, including usability testing, concept validation, and customer surveys.”]

- **What are the overarching goals for user research this year?**

[Insert details, e.g., “To improve product usability, validate new features, and align product strategy with user needs.”]

- **What constraints or priorities influence the budget (e.g., cost caps, specific stakeholders)?**

[Insert details, e.g., “We need to keep costs lean but prioritize participant incentives and new tools for analysis.”]

**Define the scope of the budget:**

Help me clarify what the annual budget needs to cover.

- What key components should the budget include (e.g., recruitment, tools, staffing, travel)?
- How can I account for recurring needs, like software licenses, and one-off costs for specific projects?

**Break down costs by project:**

Guide me in estimating costs for each research initiative planned for the year.

- How can I estimate costs for participant recruitment, incentives, and data collection for each project?
- What additional costs might arise for specialized projects (e.g., accessibility testing, global user research)?

**Identify ongoing and shared resources:**

Help me factor in shared resources that span multiple projects.

- What tools, subscriptions, or software licenses should I include?
- How can I account for team time or external vendor support across projects?

**Account for training and development:**

Guide me in budgeting for team growth and skill development.

- How can I balance professional development with other priorities?

**Build flexibility into the budget:**

Help me plan for unexpected changes or additional projects.

- What percentage of the budget should be set aside for flexibility?

**Present and justify the budget:**

Help me structure the annual budget in a clear and compelling format.

- How should I organize and label costs for transparency and ease of understanding?
- What rationale can I use to justify the proposed expenses to leadership or finance teams?

## **Reflection questions:**

Help me ensure the budget is thorough, realistic, and aligned with organizational priorities:

- Have I accounted for all critical costs, including long-term needs and shared resources?
- Does the budget align with the research goals and organizational strategy?
- What steps can I take to validate or refine the budget before submitting it?

Please guide me step-by-step to create a comprehensive and realistic annual user research budget for multiple projects, ensuring it aligns with organizational goals and priorities.”
