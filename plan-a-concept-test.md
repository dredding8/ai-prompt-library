# Plan a concept test

Category: Planning
Information needed?: Information needed

## **Context:**

You need to evaluate an early-stage concept with users to determine whether it resonates, what they like or dislike, and what improvements are needed. Use this prompt to design a concept test that helps you gather clear, actionable feedback before moving into development.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM, and fill in the placeholders to build a complete concept testing plan.

“I’m planning a concept test for [brief description of the concept, e.g., ‘a new mobile feature for tracking daily hydration’]. Help me create a structured and actionable plan to evaluate this concept.

## **Define the concept and goals**:

- What is the concept I’m testing?
    - Concept: [Describe it simply and clearly, e.g., ‘A feature that lets users set water intake goals and track their progress daily.’]
- What do I want to learn from this concept test?
    - Goal 1: [e.g., Assess initial user interest.]
    - Goal 2: [e.g., Understand perceived value.]
    - Goal 3: [e.g., Identify potential concerns.]

## **Identify my audience**:

- Who should test this concept? Example criteria:
    - Demographics: [Insert, e.g., ‘Ages 20-40, frequent fitness app users.’]
    - Behaviors: [Insert, e.g., ‘People who track their health or hydration regularly.’]
    - How many participants will I need? [Insert estimated number, e.g., 5-8 for qualitative feedback or 20+ for quantitative validation.]

## **Design the test format**:

- What materials will I use to present the concept?
    - Example: Wireframes, mockups, an interactive prototype, or concept descriptions.
- How will I run the test?
    - Moderated or unmoderated? [Choose one.]
- Platform: [Insert tool, e.g., ‘Zoom, UserTesting, or Figma prototype.’]

## **Plan my discussion or questions**:

Introduction Script:

- “Thank you for joining this session. I’ll share a concept with you, and I’d love to hear your thoughts—what you like, what confuses you, and any suggestions.”

Questions to ask participants:

- Initial reactions:
    - “Explain your first thoughts when looking at this concept”
- Clarity:
    - “How would you explain this concept to someone else?”
- Concerns:
    - “What’s missing or unclear about this concept?”
    - “Walk me through how this concept relates to the problem we discussed.”
    - “Describe anything confusing or missing within the concept, especially when it comes to [specific problem]”
    - “Tell me about how this concept compares to how you currently solve [specific problem]”

## **Reflection questions to prepare for analysis**:

- What would a successful concept test look like?
- What assumptions am I trying to evaluate or challenge?
- How will I measure success (e.g., majority positive reactions, specific concerns addressed)?

## **Deliverable output**:

Please format this into a structured concept test plan ready to share with my team.”

## Follow-up prompts:

1. “What assumptions have I made in this test plan, and how could they affect the results? Suggest ways to validate or address these assumptions.”
2. “Are there any gaps in my participant criteria that could bias the feedback? Recommend refinements to ensure I’m testing with the right audience.”
3. “What’s missing from my discussion guide or questions that could uncover deeper insights? Suggest 2-3 additional probing questions I should include.”
4. “How can I ensure the materials (e.g., wireframes, mockups) clearly communicate the concept without leading participants? Provide suggestions for improving clarity.”
5. “If my time or resources were cut in half, what’s the most critical part of this concept test to prioritize?”
