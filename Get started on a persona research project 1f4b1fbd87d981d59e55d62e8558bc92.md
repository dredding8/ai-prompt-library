[Insert details, e.g., “A productivity app for remote teams.”]

[Insert goals, e.g., “To better understand different types of users and tailor our onboarding experience.”]

[Insert user details, e.g., “Remote workers, team managers, and freelance professionals.”]

Help me clarify why I’m creating these personas.

- What decisions or strategies will the personas influence?
- How can I ensure the objectives are specific and actionable?

**Plan the research:**

Guide me in selecting methods and approaches for collecting data.

- What types of data should I gather to create meaningful personas (e.g., demographic, behavioral, attitudinal)?
