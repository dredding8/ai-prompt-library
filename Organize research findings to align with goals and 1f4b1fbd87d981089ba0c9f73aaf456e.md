## **Context:**

After completing your research, presenting findings in a way that is both purposeful and actionable is critical. This prompt helps you organize your insights so they align with specific goals, resonate with your audience, and drive decisions.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM. Fill in the placeholders to organize your research findings with clarity and intent.

“I need help organizing research findings to align with specific goals and research objectives. Guide me through a structured method for organizing and presenting insights that are clear, purposeful, and actionable.

**Define the goals and objectives:**

- What were the research objectives for this project?
    - Example: “Understand why users abandon their shopping carts during checkout.”
- Who is the audience for these findings, and what decisions will they make based on them
    - Example: The product team, who will prioritize checkout flow improvements.

**Identify key insights:**

Summarize the top findings that directly address the research objectives:

- Insight 1: [Insert key finding, e.g., “Users drop off at the payment page due to confusion about fees.”]
- Insight 2: [Insert key finding, e.g., “Users want more payment options like PayPal.”]

**Provide evidence to support each insight:**

- Example for Insight 1: “60% of participants expressed frustration over hidden fees, leading to checkout abandonment.”

**Organize findings into categories or themes:**

Break down the findings into categories that align with the research goals or audience priorities:

- Category 1: [Insert, e.g., “Pain Points in Checkout Flow.”]
- Category 2: [Insert, e.g., “Opportunities for Improvement.”]
- Category 3 (optional): [Insert, e.g., “Unmet User Expectations.”]

**Create an action-oriented summary for each category:**

For each category, summarize the key insights and their implications: Example for “Pain Points in Checkout Flow”:

- Insight: “Users abandon carts due to hidden fees.”
- Action: “Clarify fee visibility on the product page to reduce abandonment.”

Ensure every category is linked to a clear, actionable recommendation.

## Reflection questions:

1. Does the structure of my findings address the most critical stakeholder priorities?
2. Am I highlighting the most impactful insights, or am I overloading with details?
3. How well do the categories align with the original research objectives?
4. Are the recommendations realistic and feasible, given current constraints?
5. What additional context or data could strengthen the narrative?

## Summarize findings for stakeholders:

Provide a clear one-page summary with categories, insights, and actions.

Please expand this into a structured findings summary that aligns with the research objectives and drives actionable stakeholder decisions.”

## **Follow-Up Prompts:**

- “Draft a one-pager summarizing the findings into categories, insights, and recommendations.”
- “Suggest a visual framework (e.g., table, chart, infographic) to make the findings more engaging and digestible.”
- “Write a brief for stakeholders explaining how these findings address their priorities.”
- “Propose next steps for validating or acting on the recommendations outlined in the findings.”
- “What gaps exist in the current findings, and how can I address them to make the narrative more robust?”
