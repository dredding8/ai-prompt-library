Category: Planning, Stakeholder management, Workshop
Information needed?: Starting from scratch

**Context:**

Running a question-gathering workshop can help align stakeholders on key research priorities for the quarter or year, but starting from scratch can feel overwhelming. This prompt guidesyou step-by-step to define the purpose, design the workshop, and create an agenda that fosters collaboration and clarity.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help planning a question-gathering workshop.

“I want to run a workshop with stakeholders to gather their big questions for the quarter/year, but I’m not sure how to plan or facilitate it. Act as a thought partner and guide me step-by-step to define the workshop purpose, create an agenda, and design activities to uncover meaningful questions. Assume I’m starting from scratch. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**Workshop context:**

- Who are the stakeholders participating in the workshop?

[Insert details, e.g., “Product managers, designers, and marketing leads.”]

- What are the primary goals of the workshop?

[Insert goals, e.g., “To understand the key research questions stakeholders need answered for upcoming projects.”]

- What time frame are the questions focused on?

[Insert time frame, e.g., “The next quarter” or “The next year.”]

**Define the workshop’s purpose and outcomes:**

Help me clarify the purpose of this workshop.

- What should stakeholders walk away with (e.g., a prioritized list of research questions)?
- How can I align the workshop goals with the organization’s broader priorities?

**Choose the type of workshop:**

Guide me in selecting the most effective format for this workshop.

- What type of activities could help uncover meaningful questions (e.g., brainstorming, card sorting, prioritization)?
- How can I balance open-ended exploration with structured decision-making?

**Plan the agenda:**

Help me outline a clear and engaging agenda for the workshop.

- What are the key sections or phases of the workshop?
- How can I structure the agenda to encourage participation and focus on actionable outcomes?
- What is a realistic time frame for each activity?

**Design the activities:**

Help me brainstorm specific activities to achieve the workshop goals.

- How can I guide stakeholders to articulate their big questions clearly?
- What techniques can I use to prioritize questions and identify overlaps or themes?
- How can I ensure all participants feel heard and engaged?

**Facilitation and logistics:**

Guide me in preparing to facilitate the workshop effectively.

- What strategies can I use to encourage collaboration and manage differing perspectives?
- How can I handle challenges, like participants struggling to articulate questions or dominating the conversation?
- What logistics (e.g., tools, room setup, remote participation) should I consider?

## **Reflection questions:**

Help me evaluate and refine the workshop plan to ensure it meets the goals:

- Does the agenda align with the workshop’s purpose?
- Will the activities generate clear, actionable outcomes?
- What steps can I take to ensure follow-through on the questions gathered?

Please guide me step-by-step to create a workshop plan and agenda that helps stakeholders articulate and align on their big research questions, while fostering collaboration and engagement.”

## **Follow-up prompts:**

- “Help me draft a summary of the workshop’s purpose and goals to share with stakeholders beforehand.”
- “Suggest tools or templates to facilitate question-gathering activities (e.g., Miro boards, spreadsheets).”
- “Propose strategies for synthesizing and prioritizing questions after the workshop.”
- “Create a checklist for preparing the workshop and ensuring its success.”
- “Help me draft follow-up communication to share the outcomes of the workshop with stakeholders.”
- “Help me draft a response to pushback for the workshop.”
