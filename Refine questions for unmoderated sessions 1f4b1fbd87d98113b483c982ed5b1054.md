Information needed?: Information needed

## **Context:**

Unmoderated sessions require questions that are concise, unbiased, and clear enough for participants to complete independently. This prompt helps you refine lengthy or complex questions into simple, unbiased ones that elicit actionable responses.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to refine and improve your questions for unmoderated sessions.

“I need help rewriting questions for an unmoderated research session. These questions should be concise, unbiased, and easy for participants to understand without guidance. Use the following steps to refine them.

**Provide context for the research session:**

- What is the purpose of the session?
    - Example: “To test a new checkout process for clarity and usability.”
- What do I want participants to achieve or share?
    - Example: “I want participants to share their thoughts as they complete a purchase flow.”

**Evaluate the original questions:**

What are the current questions? Example:

1. “What do you think about the design of the checkout page? Do you find it helpful or confusing?”
2. “Was the process easy to follow, or were there steps where you got stuck?”

Refine the questions for clarity and simplicity:

1. Shorten lengthy questions into single, clear prompts.
    1. Original: “What do you think about the design of the checkout page? Do you find it helpful or confusing?”
    2. Revised: “Describe your first impression of the checkout page.”
2. Reword leading or biased questions to be neutral.
    1. Original: “Was the process easy to follow, or were there steps where you got stuck?”
    2. Revised: “What was your experience completing the checkout process?”
3. Ensure each question has a single focus.
    1. Original: “What do you think about the layout and the colors of the page?”
    2. Revised: “What do you think about the layout of the page?”

## Reflection questions:

- Are these questions simple and easy for participants to answer without clarification?
- Do they avoid suggesting a “right” answer or steering participants?
- Do they focus on specific actions or thoughts relevant to the research goals?
- Are there any unnecessary details or words that could confuse participants?

Please rewrite the provided questions to be concise, unbiased, and actionable for an unmoderated session.”

## **Follow-Up Prompts:**

- “Draft an introduction script for the unmoderated session to set expectations and ensure participants feel confident.”
- “Suggest additional questions to explore participant behaviors while keeping the session short.”
- “Provide a checklist for reviewing unmoderated session questions for clarity and bias.”
- “Rewrite follow-up or task-specific questions to be even more user-friendly.”
- “Write a troubleshooting question to collect feedback if participants can’t complete a task.”
