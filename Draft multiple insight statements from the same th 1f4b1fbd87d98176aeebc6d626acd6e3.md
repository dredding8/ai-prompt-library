# Draft multiple insight statements from the same theme

Category: Reporting, Synthesis
Information needed?: Information needed

**Context:**

You’ve identified a solid theme—but depending on who you’re sharing it with, how you say it matters. This prompt helps you reframe a single research insight in multiple ways—tailoring the language, emphasis, or format for different audiences like product, design, or execs.

**Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help writing multiple versions of an insight statement based on one core theme.

I need help turning a core research theme into multiple insight statements for different audiences. Act as a thought partner to help me reframe the same idea depending on who I’m speaking to—without changing the meaning. I want versions that resonate with product managers, designers, and execs. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**1. Project context:**

- **What is the original theme or insight?**

[Insert the raw theme, e.g., “Users don’t trust the suggested actions because they don’t understand where they come from.”]

- **What kind of product or experience is this insight related to?**

[Insert details, e.g., “An AI-powered recommendation system for content creators.”]

- **Who are the different audiences this insight needs to be shared with?**

[Insert details, e.g., “Product managers, designers, execs, and data science.”]

**Guide me through reframing this insight for different audiences:**

**2. Identify what each audience cares about:**

Help me understand how to tailor the framing.

- What do product managers need from an insight (e.g., clarity, trade-offs, decision paths)?
- What matters most to designers (e.g., usability, trust, emotional friction)?
- What framing resonates with execs (e.g., impact, risk, opportunity)?

**3. Write multiple versions of the insight:**

Help me rewrite this core theme into different styles.

- A concise version that could go in a deck
- A storytelling version for a verbal readout
- A tactical version that leads to specific design or product recommendations
- A strategic version that ties to roadmap or business outcomes

**4. Add nuance without losing clarity:**

Guide me in balancing specificity with generalizability.

- How can I acknowledge complexity without watering down the point?
- What qualifiers or supporting context can I include to strengthen the insight?

1. **Evaluate tone and intent:**

Help me sense-check that the reworded insights still reflect the core user need.

- Am I staying true to what users actually said and experienced?
- Have I introduced any unintended bias or spin?

**6. Reflection and refinement:**

Help me assess whether these variations are effective and appropriate.

- Do they each serve a different purpose while staying connected to the original theme?
- Will these help different stakeholders understand the same problem from their own lens?
- What other formats (e.g., one-liners, evidence-backed blurbs, analogies) might help?

Please guide me step-by-step to reframe a core insight into multiple versions tailored to different audiences—without losing meaning or depth.

**Follow-up prompts:**

- Help me practice saying the same insight out loud in different tones (tactical vs strategic)
- Suggest a visual or quote to pair with this insight in a deck
- Draft a “what this means for you” version of the insight for each stakeholder group
- Recommend common traps to avoid when reframing insights for leadership
- Help me combine this insight with others to tell a broader story
