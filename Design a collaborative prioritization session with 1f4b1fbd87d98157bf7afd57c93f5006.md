# Design a collaborative prioritization session with stakeholders

Category: Planning, Stakeholder management, Workshop
Information needed?: Starting from scratch

**Context:**

Sometimes the hardest part of research isn’t gathering insights—it’s getting teams to align on what to *do* with them. This prompt helps you design and facilitate a collaborative session that gets stakeholders to prioritize user needs, product ideas, or research focus areas—together.

**Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to get help designing a stakeholder prioritization session.

I need help planning a collaborative session with stakeholders to prioritize a set of user needs, opportunities, or research areas. Act as a thought partner to help me design the structure, define the decision criteria, and run the session in a way that leads to alignment and next steps. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**1. Project context:**

- **What are stakeholders being asked to prioritize?**

[Insert, e.g., “A list of 12 usability issues from recent research.”]

- **Who will be in the session, and what are their roles?**

[Insert, e.g., “PMs, designers, engineering leads, marketing.”]

- **What decision or plan will this prioritization feed into?**

[Insert, e.g., “Next sprint planning and roadmap refinement.”]

**Guide me through planning the session:**

**2. Define the objective and outcome:**

Help me clarify what success looks like.

- What specific decisions should we walk away with?
- Do we need to reach full agreement—or just surface tensions?

**3. Choose a prioritization framework or method:**

Guide me in selecting the best approach.

- Should I use something like effort/impact, value/feasibility, RICE, MoSCoW, etc.?
- How do I keep it simple but still useful?

**4. Prepare materials and framing:**

Help me set up the content and context.

- How should I present the options we’re prioritizing (e.g., as themes, cards, sticky notes)?
- What background info should stakeholders have before the session?

**5. Plan the flow and facilitation:**

Guide me in designing an agenda and flow that keeps momentum.

- How should I structure the discussion and voting or ranking?
- How can I make sure everyone’s voice is heard without getting stuck?

**6. Drive toward alignment and next steps:**

Help me ensure we end with clarity.

- How do we move from discussion to decision?
- What’s the best way to document outcomes and follow up?

**7. Reflection and refinement:**

Help me check whether the session is well-designed and will deliver:

- Will this session create space for both discussion and decision-making?
- Are the methods and materials clear and easy to engage with?
- What can I prepare ahead of time to reduce ambiguity or tension?

Please guide me step-by-step in designing a prioritization session that gets stakeholders aligned and confident in the path forward.

**Follow-up prompts:**

- Help me draft a slide or doc to set up the session’s purpose and structure
- Suggest ways to frame prioritization trade-offs without making it political
- Create a lightweight facilitation plan or script
- Recommend visual templates (e.g., Miro boards, matrix charts) for group activities
- Draft a follow-up summary to share the session outcomes and decisions
