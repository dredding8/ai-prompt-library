# Determine the business impact of a user research project

Category: Impact
Information needed?: Some information needed

## **Context:**

User research projects deliver value both through product insights and internal operational improvements, but articulating these impacts can be challenging. This prompt provides guidance on brainstorming metrics to demonstrate the business value and operational efficiency of your research efforts.

## **Prompt:**

Copy and paste this into your LLM to brainstorm impact metrics for your user research project.

“I need help determining the business impact of a user research project and brainstorming both product-related metrics and internal operational metrics. Guide me step-by-step through identifying measurable impacts and generating meaningful metrics. Assume I’m not sure where to start and need practical examples and suggestions.

**Define the research goals and outcomes:**

How can I identify the core outcomes of this research project?

- What specific user problems or product areas does this research address?
- How does this research impact internal operations, such as workflows, decision-making, or recruitment processes?

**Connect the research to business impact:**

What steps can I take to link the outcomes of this research to broader business goals?

- How can I connect user insights to metrics like increased user retention, revenue growth, or reduced churn?
- What strategies can I use to translate qualitative findings into measurable business outcomes?

**Brainstorm product-related metrics:**

What metrics might demonstrate the impact of this research on the product?

- How can I measure improvements in the user experience (e.g., task success rate, Net Promoter Score, or user satisfaction)?
- What metrics could show changes in user behavior (e.g., time to complete a task, feature adoption rate)?

**Brainstorm operational metrics:**

What internal metrics might demonstrate the operational value of this research?

- How can I measure improvements in research efficiency (e.g., reduced time to insights or faster recruitment timelines)?
- What metrics could reflect the value of collaboration (e.g., increased stakeholder engagement or alignment)?
- How do I capture cost savings or process improvements resulting from this project?

## **Reflect and prioritize:**

Help me prioritize which metrics are most meaningful for demonstrating impact.

- Are these metrics directly linked to the goals of the research project?
- Are they feasible to measure with the data and tools I have available?
- How can I balance metrics that highlight product impact with those showing operational efficiency?

Please provide step-by-step guidance to identify and refine business and operational metrics for this research project, along with ideas for communicating these impacts to stakeholders.”

## **Follow-up prompts:**

- “Suggest ways to track or measure the proposed metrics effectively.”
- “Help me draft a summary of the project’s business and operational impacts for stakeholders.”
- “Propose strategies for validating and refining the chosen metrics over time.”
- “Create a checklist for linking research outcomes to measurable business value.”
- “Suggest examples of operational metrics from similar research projects.”
