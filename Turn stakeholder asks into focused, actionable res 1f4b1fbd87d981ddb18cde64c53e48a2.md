Information needed?: Information needed

**Context:**

Stakeholders often share vague questions, assumptions, or requests that need translation into structured research opportunities. This prompt helps you work through ambiguity, identify what’s really being asked, and scope high-value research projects that meet both user and business needs.

I need help translating stakeholder questions and requests into clear, actionable research opportunities. Act as a thought partner to help me work through the ambiguity, clarify what’s really being asked, and define how research can support it. Assume I’m starting from scattered inputs. Here’s some context to help tailor the guidance:

**1. Organizational context:**

- **What kinds of stakeholder questions or requests are coming in?**

[Insert examples, e.g., “Why are people dropping off during onboarding?” or “Do users even want this feature?”]

- **What teams or individuals are asking them?**

[Insert details, e.g., “Product managers, marketing leads, and design.”]

- **What are their underlying goals or concerns?**

[Insert what you know, e.g., “Improve activation and reduce churn.”]

**Guide me through mapping these into research:**

**2. Clarify the stakeholder intent:**

Help me unpack what stakeholders really want to learn or decide.

- What assumptions are baked into the way the question is asked?
- What decision or action is this question tied to?
- Are they asking for research, or just a quick gut check?

**3. Identify the real research opportunity:**

Guide me in turning ambiguous questions into focused research goals.

- What’s the core user behavior, need, or experience underneath this question?
- Can I turn this into a clear “how might we” or research objective?

**4. Scope the research opportunity:**

Help me outline what a research response could look like.

- What approach or methods would fit this question best?
- Is this something we can explore now, or does it belong on the backlog?
- What constraints do I need to keep in mind (timing, data, access)?

**5. Communicate back to stakeholders:**

Help me reframe the question and align on a clear path forward.

- How should I rephrase the research opportunity to show strategic value?
- What’s the best way to validate with the stakeholder before kicking it off?

**6. Reflection and refinement:**

Help me reflect on whether these opportunities are strong, scoped, and aligned.

- Are these researchable questions that connect to decisions?
- Have I removed ambiguity and translated the ask into something actionable?
- What gaps or risks still need to be clarified?

Please guide me step-by-step to translate stakeholder questions and requests into research opportunities that are focused, feasible, and strategically valuable.

**Follow-up prompts:**

- Help me draft an intake form or template to capture stakeholder questions
- Suggest a framework to evaluate whether a stakeholder request is a research priority
- Draft an email to reframe a vague request into a defined research opportunity
- Create a playbook for recurring types of stakeholder asks and how to respond to them
- Propose ways to proactively identify patterns in stakeholder questions across teams
